"Smokefree","Key Terms","Workplace  Analysis","Law 26687 contains a definition of ÔÇ£enclosed workplaceÔÇØ that includes any enclosed area of a workplace. The decree implementing the law further clarifies that a ""work place"" is any workplace covered under Law 19587 ÔÇô the Health and Workplace Safety Law. This law applies to all workplaces, regardless of the economic nature of the work activity, and thus would also cover volunteers. Together, these definitions align with the definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. ","There is no national legislation addressing smoking in workplaces and therefore the term ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ is not defined in national law. In Australia, restrictions and prohibitions on smoking in workplaces generally fall within the jurisdiction of the States and Territories, all of which have laws addressing smoking that may contain a definition of ÔÇ£workplace.ÔÇØ ","Having no definition for this key term makes interpretation of many provisions difficult.  This can hamper application and implementation of FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.  

A definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ should be provided in accordance with the definition supplied by FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 20.","Undefined key terms or ambiguous definitions can undermine the application of other substantive provisions of a law. For example, if it is not clear what is considered ÔÇ£workplace,ÔÇØ this may impair the ability of the law to fulfill FCTC Art. 8 requirements. 
A definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ should be provided in accordance with the definition provided in FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 20.
","The law does not contain a definition of ÔÇ£workplace.ÔÇØ  However, a definition is not technically necessary for interpretation of the law because the term ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ is not used.  ","This definition does not align with the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. It is more limiting and less protective than the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines definition because it applies only to permanent, and not temporary, work spaces that are simultaneously used by a number of people. A definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ should be provided in accordance with the definition provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. ","The regulations contain a definition of ""office premises,"" rather than a definition of ""workplace."" The definition of ""office premises"" is narrower than the definition of ""workplace"" contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines in that it covers only those places in which ""administrative or clerical"" work is carried out, whereas the definition of ""workplace"" in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines covers places where all types of work is carried out. This could have the unintended effect of permitting smoking in some types of workplaces. However, because the regulations also prohibit smoking in ""factories,"" ""government premises,"" and many enumerated public places, virtually all ""workplaces""  (as defined in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines) are covered under the smoking ban. In addition, the definition of ""premises"" is broader than the definition of ""workplace"" in that it also covers ""adjoining land used in connection therewith."" Because the law prohibits smoking in ""offices premises,"" smoking is prohibited in outdoor as well as indoor areas of workplaces. 
<br><br>
Although the law appears to have a comprehensive ban on smoking in workplaces, in order not to unintentionally exclude some workplaces, and to fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law or regulations should provide a definition of ""workplace"" in accordance with the definition in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. ","The definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ in the implementing decree aligns with the definition of ""workplace"" provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. ","The definition of ÔÇ£work spaceÔÇØ in the Non-smokers' Health Act aligns with the definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. This law applies to federally-regulated workplaces only.

In Canada, smoking restrictions in public places and workplaces generally fall under within the scope of provincial, territorial, and municipal legislation, which may also contain a definition of ÔÇ£workplace.ÔÇØ ","The definition of ÔÇ£interior workplaceÔÇØ in the law aligns with the definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. However, the notion of ÔÇ£regardless of whether the work is done for compensation or on a voluntary basisÔÇØ is not explicitly mentioned.  ","The law does not contain a definition of ÔÇ£workplace.ÔÇØ Failure to define key terms can impede implementation and enforcement of substantive provisions in the law, and impede efforts to meet obligations under FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.

","The hazards of tobacco smoke exposure in the workplace are not specifically addressed by laws or regulations/rules in China.
 
Undefined key terms or ambiguous definitions can undermine the application of other substantive provisions of a law. For example, if it is not clear what is considered a ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ , this may impair the ability of the law to fulfill FCTC Art. 8 requirements.

","The definition of ÔÇ£work placeÔÇØ contained in Law No. 1335 aligns with the definition provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.

","The Tobacco Control Law and Tobacco Control Regulations contain similar but not identical definitions of ÔÇ£work place.ÔÇØ The LawÔÇÖs definition excludes ÔÇ£houses intended exclusively for family residence,ÔÇØ and the RegulationsÔÇÖ definition does not. However, the RegulationsÔÇÖ substantive provision (Art. 5(b)) excludes ÔÇ£houses intended exclusively for family residenceÔÇØ from the smoking ban, so the law and regulation have the same substantive effect. FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 21 states: ÔÇ£careful consideration should be given to workplaces that are individualsÔÇÖ homesÔÇØ as these places ÔÇ£constitute a workplace for others, who should be protected from exposure to tobacco smoke.ÔÇØ To fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the drafters of the law should consider including workplaces that are individualsÔÇÖ homes within the smoking ban. 
<br><br>
The RegulationsÔÇÖ definition of ÔÇ£work placeÔÇØ also differs from the LawÔÇÖs definition in that it includes ÔÇ£openÔÇØ workplaces, thereby including outdoor workplaces under the smoking ban. In this regard, it is more protective than the minimum requirements of FCTC Art. 8.
","The lack of definition for this key term could lead to difficulty in interpreting and enforcing the ban on smoking in workplaces.  To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ in accordance with the definition in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.","Undefined key terms or ambiguous definitions can undermine the application of other substantive provisions of a law.

A definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ should be provided in accordance with the definition provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. ","Although ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ is not defined in the definition section, Section 2 of the Act substantively covers what is considered a workplace.

Having no definition for this key term makes interpretation of many provisions difficult. This can hamper application and implementation of FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. 

A definition of ""workplace"" should be provided in accordance with the definition supplied by FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 20.
","This definition does not align with the definition provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. It is more limiting and less protective than the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines definition because it only applies to workplaces where employees or workers are hired and does not explicitly include voluntary work.  Nonetheless, the effect of the ban may be complete because all enclosed public places are covered under the ban as well.

The Labor Standards Act defines worker as: ""one who is employed at an enterprise or office (here referred to as ""enterprise"") and receives wages therefrom, without regard to the kind of occupation."" Therefore, workplace guidelines on smoking appear to apply to industrial, business and office settings. However, in practice, the Workplace Guidelines on smoking have not been applied to employees that work in public places, such as restaurants, hotels, bars, hospitals, schools, etc.  In addition, ""employee"" clearly does not encompass domestic workers, volunteers, and workers in family-run businesses, and therefore the workplace guidelines do not apply to these situations.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because the workplace guidelines on smoking do not apply to all workplace settings and employees.

	Article 23 of Law 26687 prohibits smoking in enclosed workplaces covered under Health and Workplace Safety Law No. 19,587, which applies to ÔÇ£all establishments and operations, whether for profit or not-for-profit, whatever the economic nature of their activities, the setting where they are performed, the character of the facilities and work stations and types of machinery, materials, devices or procedures that are used or adopted.ÔÇØ Thus, Law 26687 applies to all workplaces.</p>
<p>
	However, Art. 24 of Law 26687 sets forth three exemptions to the workplace smoking ban: 1) enclosed private office space that is not shared with other workers and is not used for public services (this exemption permits smoking in office spaces used by a sole person with no other employees); 2) clubs for smokers of tobacco products, and; 3) tobacco shops with specialized areas authorized by the competent local authority. Decree 602 regulates and narrows these exemptions, specifying that: 1) private office spaces may not receive the public under any circumstances, or have any kind of permanent or temporary employee or worker doing a job in such a space, or contiguous spaces; 2) clubs for smokers must be organized as a non-profit used by members only, not the general public, in which an employee may perform no work other than offering a space for smoking tobacco; and 3) tobacco shops must be exclusively for the sale of tobacco and tobacco accessories for consumption of tobacco, and employees may not remain in the tobacco tasting area.</p>
<p>
	Because of these limited exemptions to the ban on smoking in indoor workplaces, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke Free.ÔÇØ To align with best practices as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, and to ensure universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure, the law should require all parts of all indoor workplaces to be 100% smoke free.</p>
","<p>
	In Australia, restrictions and prohibitions on smoking generally fall within the jurisdiction of the States and Territories. Most of the States and Territories ban smoking in all indoor workplaces. However, one or more jurisdictions permits smoking in private gaming areas within a bar, club or hotel, high roller rooms at casinos, hotel guest rooms, and in designated areas in mental health facilities, all of which are a workplace for some people. For this reason, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is Restricted,ÔÇØ rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke Free,ÔÇØ is given for all indoor workplaces.</p>
<p>
	FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 24 provides that Parties have a continuous obligation to remove any exemptions as soon as possible, and each Party should strive to provide universal protection within five years of the WHO Framework ConventionÔÇÖs entry into force for that Party.</p>

	The law prohibits smoking in public places but is subject to the provisions of Art. 7 that permit a person in control of a public place to create a zone for smoking. The smoking zones, in turn, are subject to restrictions provided in the 2006 Rules; however, rules have not yet been drafted for the 2013 law. The law does not require that all indoor workplaces be 100% smoke free. Therefore, the law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines and, accordingly, does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor workplaces to be 100% smoke free.</p>

	The law generally prohibits smoking in public places and does not address ÔÇ£workplacesÔÇØ specifically. Instead, the law includes a non-exhaustive list of public places, most of which are also workplaces.

","<p>The law prohibits smoking in any public or private shared enclosed space.┬á A ÔÇ£shared enclosed spaceÔÇØ is considered to be ÔÇ£any space accessible to the public, intended for simultaneous use by several people.ÔÇØ┬á Because the vast majority of workplaces can┬áalso be considered a┬áÔÇ£shared enclosed space,ÔÇØ the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in shared indoor workplaces. Enclosed workplaces with only┬áone worker (e.g., residences with a domestic or child care worker), for example, may not be covered under the law. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ for all indoor workplaces.</p>
<p>
	For clarity and┬áto fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law or subsequent regulations should specifically prohibit smoking in┬áall parts of all enclosed workplaces.

	The law states that the Health Minister may specify any ""premises or building or any such part thereof"" as a place in which smoking is not permitted. The First Schedule of the regulations list numerous premises and buildings in which smoking is completely prohibited, including, among others: government premises, office premises, factories and workshops, restaurants, hotels and many other workplaces and public places. Thus, although the definition of ""office premises"" only covers places in which ""administrative or clerical"" work is carried out, the inclusion of many other types of workplaces in the First Schedule means almost all ""workplaces"" (as defined in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines) are covered under the smoking ban. However, hotel guestrooms, which are workplaces for some, are specifically not covered under the ban. Because smoking is not prohibited in hotel guest rooms and some workplaces may be unintentionally excluded from the list, the regulatory status ""Smoking is Restricted"" is given.</p>
<p>
	To ensure alignment with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law or regulations should include a definition of ""workplace"" in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines and prohibit smoking in all ""workplaces"".</p>

	The Non-smokersÔÇÖ Health Regulations, issued pursuant to the Non-smokersÔÇÖ Health Act, prohibit smoking in federally-regulated workplaces, with a few very limited exceptions. The following rooms/areas of a federally-regulated workplace may be designated by an employer as a smoking room/area: a) any living accommodation; b) any motor vehicle, lighthouse, crane cab, caboose, locomotive, or other room or area in the work space (i) that is not incorporated within any other work space, (ii) that does not share a ventilation system with any other work space, and (iii) to which only one person normally has access during a shift; and c) any room on a ship to which only one person normally has access during a shift.┬á</p>
<p>
	Other workplaces (i.e., private and provincial/territorial government workplaces, and most non-government workplaces) are governed by sub-national jurisdictions. The sub-national legislation is comprehensive and smoking is prohibited in workplaces with a few exceptions. Designated smoking rooms are permitted by some sub-national jurisdictions for some workplaces that are residential in nature (i.e., in designated areas or rooms in long-term residential care facilities and hotel guest rooms), often with strict ventilation regulations.┬á</p>

Specifically, smoking is permitted in designated rooms in hotels, long term care homes, palliative hospices, prisons, and offshore installations such as oil rigs; and smoking is permitted for sampling cigars or pipe tobacco in specialist tobacco shops. Smoking is permitted in private dwellings used as a workplace for certain types of activities. In addition, the law provides that if only part of the premises is used as a place of work, the premises are smoke free only to that extent. This provision may limit the application of the law and protection against tobacco smoke exposure, depending on the particular premises. Although in practice virtually all workplaces are 100% smoke free, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given, rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ because of the limited exceptions.</p>

(Smoking areas, however, may be located outside pursuant to government guidelines.)┬á The ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ regulatory status results from (1) inconsistencies regarding the smoke free status of workplaces (some workplaces are smoke free because the smoking area is outdoors while other workplaces are not smoke free because of indoor smoking areas) and (2) the fact that smoke free status depends upon local implementing legislation.┬á The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of Government Regulation (PP) 109 of 2012 requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act. Some local governments have passed legislation requiring designated smoking areas indoors, others have passed legislation requiring 100% smoke free indoor workplaces with smoking areas outside, while many others have not passed any legislation. Thus, indoor workplaces are designated as ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ because of the varying regulatory schemes across sub-national jurisdictions.</p>
<p>
	The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

	As the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines provide, careful consideration should be given to workplaces that are dwellings and workplaces that contain residential areas to ensure that people are protected from tobacco smoke exposure. To ensure universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure, the law should require all parts of all workplaces, including those of a residential nature, to be 100% smoke free.

The law aligns with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, with respect to government facilities.","The Australian Public Service Commission adopted a smoke free work environment policy in 1988, which applies to all Commonwealth workplaces. Therefore, federal government facilities are smoke free.  In addition, all States and Territories have adopted laws that prohibit smoking in state and territorial government buildings.

The laws align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to government facilities.","The law prohibits smoking in government offices and semi-government offices but is subject to the provisions of Art. 7 that permit a person in control of a public place to create a zone for smoking. The smoking zones, in turn, are subject to restrictions provided in the 2006 Rules; however, rules have not yet been drafted for the 2013 law.  The law also prohibits smoking in any place accessible for public use, which would encompass government facilities other than offices.  Again, however, the ban is subject to provisions of Art. 7 and the 2006 Rules.
The law does not currently provide for 100% smoke free indoor government facilities. Therefore, the law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines and, accordingly, does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor government facilities to be 100% smoke free.
","The law and administrative order prohibit smoking in indoor public places and workplaces, but permit designated smoking rooms in certain places, including airports, hotels, restaurants, bars, and the like.

Decree No. 2.018 permits smoking in public federal facilities in exclusive smoking areas and in individual offices. However, the decree is subordinate to the legislation and cannot reduce or alter the coverage of the law.  Therefore, smoking is prohibited in all government facilities.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to government facilities.","Under the Tobacco Order, 2005, the Health Minister may specify any ""premises or building or any such part thereof"" as a place in which smoking is not permitted. The First Schedule of the regulations (as amended in 2012) lists ""government premises"" as a place where smoking is prohibited. Government premises is defined as ""any premises owned or occupied by the Government or any statutory body."" Therefore, smoking is prohibited in all government facilities.

In Canada, smoking restrictions in buildings operated by sub-national governments are mainly under the jurisdiction of the provinces, territories and municipalities.  Under sub-national legislation, smoking is prohibited in virtually all provincial, territorial and municipal government buildings and facilities.

The law provides for a few very limited exemptions to the comprehensive smoking ban in government facilities.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to government facilities because all government facilities are not required to be 100% indoor smoke free indoors and, therefore, universal and effective protection from exposure to tobacco smoke is not provided. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines due to the fact that it provides for the designation of smoking areas. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free. 
","Decree 74-2008 prohibits smoking in virtually all enclosed public places and workplaces (with the limited exception of hotel guestrooms), and therefore smoking is prohibited in government facilities under this decree.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to government facilities (provided that cigar factories and spaces where the tasting of tobacco takes place are not in places owned or operated by the government).  ","Section 3(5) of the Smoking Ordinance specifically provides that ÔÇ£any premises that are owned or occupied by, or under the management and control of, the GovernmentÔÇØ are no smoking areas.

","The law prohibits smoking in many public places including public offices, court buildings, libraries, and educational institutions. (Although the law permits the establishment of smoking areas or spaces in airports, airport and other public transport terminals are analyzed separately in this review.) The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines as it relates to government facilities.","Neither the Health Law nor Government Regulation (PP) No. 109 of 2012 specifically addresses government facilities. Instead, whether a government facility is a ÔÇ£smoke free areaÔÇØ depends on the type facility it is. For example, all educational and healthcare facilities, including government-run educational and healthcare facilities, are smoke free; while workplaces and public places, including governmental workplaces and public places, must have smoking areas. (Smoking areas, however, may be outside pursuant to government guidelines.) The realization of the ""100% Smoke Free"" or ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ regulatory status of government facilities depends upon local implementing legislation. The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of the PP requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act, and some local governments have passed legislation while others have not. Thus, government facilities are designated as ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ because of the varying restrictions in different types of government facilities and varying regulatory schemes across sub-national jurisdictions. 
<br>
<br>
The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces, including government facilities, to be 100% smoke free.
","Smoking is prohibited in government facilities.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it permits designated smoking rooms in some government facilities.  To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all government facilities.","The regulations prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places without exception.  The Second Schedule includes a non-exhaustive list of places where smoking is prohibited, and specifically includes government-occupied buildings.

","Article 25 of the Health Promotion asks managers of certain enumerated public places, including ÔÇ£government buildingsÔÇØ, to ÔÇ£try to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent passive smoking exposure.ÔÇØ HSB Notification 0025 advises prefectural governors on implementation of Article 25. This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£it is desirable that, at the very least, government administration offices and medical institutions be completely smoke-free.ÔÇØ However, it stops short of requiring government buildings to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.
<br>
<br>
In addition, Article 71 of the Industrial Safety and Health Law, which may apply to government buildings as workplaces, mandates employers to ÔÇ£endeavor to create a comfortable working environment.ÔÇØ Ministry of Labour, Health and Welfare Notification No. 59 implements Article 71 and calls on employers to take ÔÇ£measures, taken as necessary, against smoking, such as designating smoking areas within the workplace, etc.ÔÇØ The 2003 Workplace Guidelines provide standards for air quality, ventilation and reverse airflow for designated smoking rooms, if established.
<br>
<br>
At the national level, the language of the laws are not obligatory in nature and do not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in government buildings, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ and ÔÇ£to endeavorÔÇØ to take measures ÔÇ£as necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law. However, in practice, many national, prefectural and local governmental buildings ban or restrict indoor smoking. 
<br>
<br>
The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free government buildings and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all government buildings to be 100% smoke free.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ, which by definition includes ÔÇ£governmental public premisesÔÇØ.  Although most governmental facilities fall into the category of ÔÇ£governmental public premisesÔÇØ, some governmental facilities may not be open to the public and therefore the ban does not apply. In addition, in practice, the smoking ban is not always enforced. For example, many members of parliament still smoke in Parliament, and Parliament is considering a ban on smoking in Parliament. See http://gulftoday.ae/portal/9c4b6663-0607-46da-a839-5bf75132b425.aspx.  Because ÔÇ£governmental public premisesÔÇØ is not currently interpreted or enforced as applying to all government facilities, the regulatory code ÔÇ£Some RestrictionsÔÇØ is assigned.

<br><br>
To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should make clear that smoking is prohibited in all indoor governmental facilities. In addition, the law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas in ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ. Finally, to clarify the scope of the ban on smoking in public places and to aid in enforcement, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.
","Section 33(2) gives an extensive list of public places and workplaces in which smoking is permitted in specially designated areas. The list includes many specific types of government facilities - such as court buildings, police stations, health institutions, and transport facilities.   The list also includes the general categories of ÔÇ£public buildingsÔÇØ and ÔÇ£workplaces,ÔÇØ which encompasses government building and workplaces.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places, including government facilities, and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","Smoking is prohibited in most public areas and work environments, including government facilities. The definitions of ÔÇ£public areaÔÇØ and ÔÇ£working area,ÔÇØ read in combination, are sufficiently broad to cover all government facilities.

The law provides that any issues that may arise as to whether smoking is allowed in any given situation should be resolved in favor of protecting all workers and members of the public by creating an environment free from tobacco smoke.  

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regards to government facilities.  For better clarity, the law should prohibit smoking in all government facilities and never permit designated smoking rooms.  
","The law prohibits smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces.

","Article 14 of the law states that it is prohibited for any person to expose another person to tobacco smoke outside places reserved for smokers. Article 15 of the law prohibits smoking in a list of places, including government offices, but states that designated smoking areas may be set up in some of those places. Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 
 

While this interpretation of the legislation aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, a future decree should clarify requirements under Articles 14 and 15 to ensure that smoking is clearly prohibited in all government facilities.
","Smoking is restricted to designated smoking areas in government office facilities and prohibited in other government facilities that are public places (e.g., government-run libraries or cultural facilities). This is because the Public Health Regulations prohibit smoking in ÔÇ£public places,ÔÇØ which by definition includes workplaces, ÔÇ£but excludes an area demarcated forÔÇØ smoking in the workplace.  Likewise, OSHA prohibits smoking in the workplace, except for areas demarcated for smoking.  

Although all public places are workplaces for someone, in practice, smoking is permitted in designated smoking areas in only those workplaces that are office settings, not those workplaces that are open to the general public. Thus, if the government facility falls under the category of a ÔÇ£workplace,ÔÇØ smoking is restricted to demarcated areas.  If the government facility falls under the category of an ÔÇ£indoor area which is open to the public,ÔÇØ smoking is prohibited.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","As a general rule, the law provides that places with public access (public places) and interior public or private work areas (workplaces), other than primary and secondary schools, may provide isolated indoor areas exclusively for smoking. While it does not provide for an express ban in government facilities, the regulations require upper ranking federal public servants to require any person found smoking to stop doing so in the office or facility assigned to his service and to immediately put out the lit tobacco product and move outdoors if s/he continues smoking, among other actions. While this implies a ban in federal government facilities, it is not clear that the ban would apply to government facilities at the sub-national level. Accordingly, the regulatory status code of ""Smoking is Restricted"" is given.

The law allows the government to issue guidelines for designated smoking areas in public places included on the lists. Such guidelines were issued and later rescinded in the interest of protecting public health.  Therefore, public places included on the lists are currently smoke free.  

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free environments in all indoor workplaces and public places, and allows for future designated smoking areas.

The detailed conditions of using tobacco products are set forth in regulations issued by the above-mentioned ministers, allowing smoking in separated areas or spaces.  

It is not clear what effect these binding regulations will have once the revised text of the Act goes into effect on November 15, 2010.  

The regulations do not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines due to the fact that they provide for the designation of smoking areas. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor workplaces and public places, including government facilities, to be 100% smoke free. ","The law prohibits smoking throughout premises occupied by state agencies or local self-government agencies, without exception.  Therefore, smoking is prohibited in all government facilities. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to government facilities. 
","The 2005 Act authorized regulations to provide for smoke free public places and workplaces. Under the 2006 Regulations, smoking is prohibited in offices and other premises that are non-domestic premises in which one or more persons work. Because government facilities are workplaces and offices for some, government facilities are smoke free. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to government facilities. ","The law prohibits smoking in any enclosed or covered public place or work place, except for in hotels, inns, guest houses, restaurants and airports where designated smoking rooms are allowed. Government facilities do not fall into any of these exempted areas from the smoking ban. Therefore, the law prohibits smoking in government facilities.  

However, as of the date of this review, required subsidiary legislation (e.g., implementing decrees and administrative orders) has not been issued by the designated regulatory authority to implement these provisions.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to government facilities.

","The law prohibits smoking in virtually all public places and enclosed workplaces (with the limited exception of hotel guestrooms), and therefore smoking is prohibited in government facilities.  

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to government facilities.  ","There is no single provision in the law or agency notification that addresses smoking in government facilities.  Instead, smoking is banned in some government facilities and not regulated in others.  Smoking is prohibited in the Supreme Court, the Subordinate Courts, and Small Claims Tribunals; and public libraries, museums, and art galleries.  The agency notification also prohibits smoking in any community building or center owned or operated by the PeopleÔÇÖs Association, a government-established statutory board whose goal it is to promote racial harmony and social cohesion.

Because many government buildings are also workplaces, these facilities are subject to some restrictions on smoking.  Smoking is permitted in areas designated by the manager for smoking.  These areas must be independently ventilated and may not be areas that are required to be used by anyone in the performance of his/her job duties or common areas for employees.  Smoking is prohibited in other areas of workplaces, namely in any enclosed corridor, lobby, stairwell, or other common area of buildings or parts of buildings that consist wholly or principally of office premises.  

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% indoor smoke free environments and, therefore, does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure in government facilities. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require that all parts of all public places and workplaces be 100% smoke free.","The law does not specifically reference government facilities. However, the law prohibits smoking in public places except in those specified public places prescribed by the Minister by regulation.  The regulations permit persons in control of workplaces to designate a smoking area, which may not exceed 25% of the total floor area. Thus, for those government facilities that are workplaces, smoking areas may be set aside in up to 25% of total floor area. The smoking area may not exceed 25% of the total floor area, must be separated from the rest of the space by a solid partition and entrance door, and must be ventilated directly to the outside.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","The law prohibits smoking in public administration offices and public law centers.

","The Tobacco Act does not specifically address smoking in government facilities, however the Act allows smoking in designated smoking areas in places that may be government owned or operated. Specifically, Section 6 of the Tobacco Act allows areas to be set aside for smoking in healthcare facilities, long term care facilities, means of transport and transport facilities, and other public premises. In schools and childcare facilities, smoking is permitted in designated smoking areas available to staff only. Because smoking is permitted in designated smoking areas in places that may be government owned or operated, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is assigned.

A ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ is defined to include a list of specified places and ÔÇ£any other enclosed place to which the public has admittanceÔÇØ. Similarly, Section 13 of the Act restricts smoking to designated smoking rooms in ÔÇ£office buildingsÔÇØ, among other places. Office buildings and ÔÇ£other enclosed places to which the public has admittanceÔÇØ are interpreted as being inclusive of government facilities.

The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law has been inconsistent. 
<br><br>
Although hospitals are currently smoke free under the law, to fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas in public places.

These areas may be present in hospitals. Therefore, the regulatory status code ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given.

The law provides that any issues that may arise as to whether smoking is allowed in any given situation should be resolved in favor of protecting all workers and members of the public by creating an environment free from tobacco smoke. 

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regards to hospitals.  To align, the law should prohibit smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces and never permit designated smoking rooms.

Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 

While this interpretation of the legislation aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, a future decree should clarify requirements under Articles 14 and 15 to ensure that smoking is clearly prohibited in all hospitals.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to hospitals.","The law provides that places with public access (public places) and interior public or private work areas (workplaces), other than primary and secondary schools, may provide isolated indoor areas exclusively for smoking. Although the law provides that these areas must be either in the open air or in isolated interior spaces, the regulations do not restrict them to open areas only. Therefore, as a matter of law, hospitals (unless they are owned or operated by the federal government) may set up isolated indoor smoking areas, provided they use mechanisms that avoid the transfer of particulates to non-smoking areas, they are not mandatory pass-through areas for non-smokers, and they meet the isolation, ventilation, and purification specifications of RGLTC Arts. 60, 61, and 63. 

However, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards. In practice, smoking areas are allowed inside public places and workplaces notwithstanding the no-transfer of particulates rule.

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8.

The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of the PP requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act, and some local governments have passed legislation while others have not. Because the national law has not been locally implemented in every jurisdiction, residential healthcare facilities are designated as ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ on a national level, rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke Free.ÔÇØ 
<br>
<br>
The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces, including patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities, to be 100% smoke free.
","Smoking may be permitted in designated patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities. The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA), Sections 47(1) and 47(8) (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 16) prohibits smoking in a ÔÇ£specified place,ÔÇØ which includes ÔÇ£a health premises.ÔÇØ A ÔÇ£health premisesÔÇØ is defined as ÔÇ£any hospital, sanatorium, home, laboratory, clinic, health care centre.ÔÇØ However, Section 47(7) exempts from the smoking ban nursing homes, hospices, and psychiatric institutions. Due to this exemption, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given. 

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor workplaces to be 100% smoke free, including patient rooms in nursing homes, hospices, and psychiatric institutions. FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 24 provides that Parties have a continuous obligation to remove any exemptions as soon as possible, and each Party should strive to provide universal protection within five years of the WHO Framework ConventionÔÇÖs entry into force for that Party. ","Generally, smoking is prohibited in hospitals and clinic buildings.  In addition, the law generally prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£an old age home or a protected living house,ÔÇØ but permits smoking in patient rooms provided the room isnÔÇÖt occupied by a non-smoker.  Any patient room where smoking is permitted must have appropriate ventilation and must not serve as a nuisance to other parts of the location.  

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities because smoking is permitted in some patient rooms in certain types of residential healthcare facilities. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all parts of residential healthcare facilities, including patient rooms.
","The regulations prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places without exception.  The Second Schedule includes a non-exhaustive list of places where smoking is prohibited, and specifically includes health facilities.  Therefore, smoking is prohibited in patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.  The ban on smoking in these places extends to cover using or holding an electronic tobacco product.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.
","Article 25 of the Health Promotion Act asks managers of certain enumerated public places, including ÔÇ£hospitalsÔÇØ to ÔÇ£try to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent passive smoking exposure.ÔÇØ HSB Notification 0025 advises prefectural governors on implementation of Article 25. This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£it is desirable that, at the very least, government administration offices and medical institutions be completely smoke-free.ÔÇØ ÔÇ£Medical institutionsÔÇØ is interpreted as covering residential healthcare facilities. However, the notification stops short of requiring medical institutions, including patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities, to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking patient rooms or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the law is not obligatory in nature and does not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in residential healthcare facilities, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ.  Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many residential healthcare facilities may ban or restrict smoking in patient rooms. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may ban or restrict smoking in patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of residential healthcare facilities, including patient rooms, to be 100% smoke free.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ, which by definition includes hospitals and health centers. In principle, patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities are part of the health center and accordingly the ban is interpreted to apply to them. Although the law authorizes the Minister of Health to allow designated smoking areas in public places, the Minister has not done so with respect to patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities as of the date of this review. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£100% smoke freeÔÇØ is given. However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law has been inconsistent. 
<br><br>
Although patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities are currently smoke free under the law, to fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas in public places. In addition, to clarify the scope of the ban and aid in enforcement, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ and in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.
","Private rooms in residential care facilities are not mentioned in the law.   Although a private room could be considered a workplace, private rooms cannot meet the criteria for specially designated smoking areas allowed under the law in indoor public places and workplaces (ventilated to the outside, in which non-smoking people do not have to enter while smoking is occurring, and which are cleaned when smoking is not occurring). Therefore, smoking is prohibited in private rooms in residential healthcare facilities.   

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.
","The law permits designated smoking rooms in residential healthcare facilities with persons incapable of moving, persons with mental disorders, or elderly persons. The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regards to patient rooms.  To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces and never permit designated smoking rooms.","The law prohibits smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces. The definition of ÔÇ£enclosed public placeÔÇØ specifically includes ÔÇ£all institutions of health,ÔÇØ including their outdoor and enclosed areas. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities.
","The law prohibits smoking in all healthcare facilities, including ÔÇ£hospitals, clinics, [and] health centersÔÇØ and ÔÇ£old age homes, homes for the handicapped . . . rehabilitation facilities and units for the accommodation and support of addicts and alcoholics.ÔÇØ The law provides for a few exemptions to the ban on smoking in public places, but patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities are not among the exemptions.  Therefore, the law is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in all residential healthcare facilities, including in patient rooms. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities.
","There is a comprehensive ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces, indoor public places, and public transport.  The law does not provide an exemption for patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.  Because patient rooms within residential healthcare facilities are workplaces for some, smoking is prohibited therein. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.","The regulations prohibit smoking in hospitals and clinics, including the area inside the building and the surrounding area up to the borders of the fence or lot. ÔÇ£HospitalÔÇØ is defined as any building ÔÇ£used for lodging, treatment and care of persons who require any form of health care services.ÔÇØ ÔÇ£Health care services,ÔÇØ in turn, is broadly defined as including, among other things, ÔÇ£(a) medical, dental, nursing, midwifery, allied health, pharmacy, and ambulance services and any other services provided by a health care professional; (b) accommodation for the purposes of any service provided by any hospital; . . . (g) and any health related services.ÔÇØ This broad definition encompasses residential healthcare facilities, and therefore smoking is prohibited in residential healthcare facilities. Because there is no exemption for patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities, the law is interpreted as prohibiting smoking all parts of residential healthcare facilities, including patient rooms. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities.","Article 14 of the law states that it is prohibited for any person to expose another person to tobacco smoke outside places reserved for smokers. Article 15 of the law prohibits smoking in a list of places, including healthcare institutions, but states that designated smoking areas may be set up in some of those places. Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 
 

While this interpretation of the legislation aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, a future decree should clarify requirements under Articles 14 and 15 to ensure that smoking is clearly prohibited in all residential healthcare facilities ÔÇô patient rooms.
","The Public Health Regulations prohibit smoking in ÔÇ£public places,ÔÇØ which is defined as ÔÇ£any indoor area which is open to the public or any part of the public.ÔÇØ Under the Regulations, as implemented in practice, residential healthcare facilities including patient rooms are considered ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ and therefore smoking is prohibited.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.","The law provides that places with public access (public places) and interior public or private work areas (workplaces), other than primary and secondary schools, may provide isolated indoor areas exclusively for smoking. Although the law provides that these areas must be either in the open air or in isolated interior spaces, the regulations do not restrict them to open air spaces only. Therefore, as a matter of law, residential healthcare facilities may set up isolated indoor smoking areas in patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities, provided they use mechanisms that avoid the transfer of particulates to non-smoking areas, they are not mandatory pass-through areas for non-smokers, and they meet the isolation, ventilation, and purification specifications of RGLTC Arts. 60, 61, and 63.

As a practical matter, however, it would be infeasible for patient rooms to meet the specifications for isolated interior smoking areas required under Arts. 61 and 63 (automatically closing door, exacting ventilation and purification systems, etc.).  

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8. Therefore, to align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should completely ban smoking in all indoor public places, workplaces, and all means of public transport.","The law comprehensively prohibits smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces without exception. The term ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ is broadly defined to include patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities. Therefore, these places are covered under the ban. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities. 

","The Tobacco Products Act prohibits smoking in a specified list of public places, which includes ÔÇ£health related institutions.ÔÇØ The law allows exemptions from the smoking ban only for airports, hotels and prisons. Because the law does not provide an exemption for patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities, the law is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to residential healthcare facilities, including patient rooms.
","The law generally prohibits smoking in workplaces.  Although the law permits smoking by residents or patients in a ÔÇ£hospital care institution, a residential disability care institution, or a rest homeÔÇØ, smoking may be allowed only in ÔÇ£dedicated smoking roomsÔÇØ and therefore is not allowed in patient rooms.  Specifically, a ÔÇ£dedicated smoking roomÔÇØ is defined as ÔÇ£an internal area in a hospital care institution, a residential disability care institution, or a rest home that is used solely to enable patients or residents who smoke to smoke, or to socialise with each other in a place where smoking is permitted.ÔÇØ  Therefore, smoking is not permitted in patient rooms because patient rooms are not a place used solely to smoke and socialize.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities.
","The law and decree allow a person in control of a public place or workplace to create designated smoking rooms, except in educational institutions and health facilities, which we interpret to include residential healthcare facilities. Although the decree does not specifically address patient rooms in residential healthcare facilities, we interpret the decree to treat such facilities synonymously with hospitals and clinics. Therefore, we interpret smoking to be prohibited in such places. The law and decree align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to patient rooms of residential healthcare facilities. ","The prohibition on smoking in workplaces and public places does not apply to designated rooms that are used as accommodation for persons aged 18 years or over in residential care homes, nursing homes, and hospices providing palliative care. The ÔÇ£designated roomÔÇØ may be a bedroom or a room used only for smoking. There must be a written sign indicating that smoking is allowed in the room.

The law allows the government to issue guidelines for designated smoking areas in public places included on the lists. Such guidelines were issued and later rescinded in the interest of protecting public health.  Therefore, public places included on the lists are currently smoke free.  

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free environments in all indoor workplaces and public places, and allows for future designated smoking areas.

Accordingly, the law and implementing rules align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.","Under the Health Law and Government Regulation (PP) No. 109 of 2012, smoking should be prohibited in non-residential healthcare facilities. However, the realization of the ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ regulatory status of non-residential healthcare facilities depends upon local implementing legislation. The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of the PP requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act, and some local governments have passed legislation while others have not.

<br>
<br>
The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces, including non-residential healthcare facilities, to be 100% smoke free.

This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£it is desirable that, at the very least, government administration offices and medical institutions be completely smoke-free.ÔÇØ ÔÇ£Medical institutionsÔÇØ is interpreted as covering non-residential healthcare facilities. However, the notification stops short of requiring medical institutions, including non-residential healthcare facilities, to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the law is not obligatory in nature and does not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in non-residential healthcare facilities, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ and ÔÇ£to endeavorÔÇØ to take measures ÔÇ£as necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many non-residential healthcare facilities ban or restrict indoor smoking. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in non-residential healthcare facilities.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free non-residential healthcare facilities and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of non-residential healthcare facilities to be 100% smoke free.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ, which by definition includes hospitals and health centers.

Therefore, because the law prohibits smoking in health centers, which is interpreted as including non-residential healthcare facilities, the regulatory status ÔÇ£100 % Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law has been inconsistent. 
<br><br>
Although non-residential healthcare facilities are currently smoke free under the law, to fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas public places.

Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 

While this interpretation of the legislation aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, a future decree should clarify requirements under Articles 14 and 15 to ensure that smoking is clearly prohibited in all non-residential healthcare facilities.

Although the law provides that these areas must be either in the open air or in isolated interior spaces, the regulations do not require them to be in open air spaces.  Therefore, as a matter of law, non-residential healthcare facilities may set up isolated indoor smoking areas in public areas, provided they use mechanisms that avoid the transfer of particulates to non-smoking areas, they are not mandatory pass-through areas for non-smokers, and they meet the isolation, ventilation. and purification specifications of RGLTC Arts. 60, 61, and 63. 

However, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards. In practice, smoking areas are allowed inside public places and workplaces notwithstanding the no-transfer of particulates rule. 

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8.

The law aligns with best practices, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.","In Australia, restrictions and prohibitions on smoking generally fall within the jurisdiction of the States and Territories.  All of the States and Territories ban smoking in childcare facilities and preschools. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.","The law prohibits smoking in educational institutions but is subject to the provisions of Art. 7 that permit a person in control of a public place to create a zone for smoking. The smoking zones, in turn, are subject to restrictions provided in the 2006 Rules, which prohibit smoking zones in childcare, primary school, high school, or any other educational facility. Rules have not yet been drafted for the 2013 law.  Therefore, smoking is completely prohibited in childcare and preschool facilities.  
The law, in conjunction with the 2006 Rules, provides for 100% smoke free childcare facilities and preschools. Therefore, the law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare and preschool facilities. 
","The law and administrative order prohibit smoking in indoor public places and workplaces, but permit designated smoking rooms in certain places, including airports, hotels, restaurants, bars, and the like. The administrative order includes a specific article stating that smoking areas may not be set up in public or private educational institutions or in establishments intended to be regularly used for the reception or activities of minors. Additionally, the law specifically cites educational institutions in a list of places which must be 100% smoke free. 

Therefore, the law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities.
","The law generally prohibits smoking in public places.  Although this term is not defined, the law specifically includes educational institutions in the non-exhaustive list of places where smoking is prohibited.  Therefore, smoking is prohibited in childcare facilities and preschools.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.  For greater clarity, the law should define the term ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ in accordance with the definition provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.
","The law prohibits smoking in any public or private shared enclosed space.  A ÔÇ£shared enclosed spaceÔÇØ is considered to be ÔÇ£any space accessible to the public, intended for simultaneous use by several people.ÔÇØ  Public places are specifically covered.  This is interpreted as covering preschool and childcare facilities.  Moreover, classrooms are also specifically mentioned as covered by the ban.  This can be interpreted as covering preschools.  Therefore, taking these provisions as a whole, smoking is prohibited in preschool and childcare facilities.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to preschool and childcare facilities.","Under the Tobacco Order, 2005, the Health Minister may specify any ""premises or building or any such part thereof"" as a place in which smoking is not permitted. The First Schedule of the regulations (as amended in 2012) lists ""any area in a child care center"" and ""any area in an educational institution"" as places where smoking is prohibited. The regulations define ÔÇ£educational Institution,ÔÇØ by reference to the Education Act, as including ÔÇ£a pre-school class, [or] a kindergarten.ÔÇØ Therefore, smoking is prohibited in childcare facilities and preschools.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.
","The law and decree prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces. The definition of ""enclosed public place"" includes a non-exhaustive list of places that are ""enclosed public places"" which includes day care centers, kindergartens, orphanages and childcare facilities.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities.
","Smoking restrictions in workplaces and public places, including childcare facilities and preschools, generally fall under the jurisdiction of the provinces, territories, and municipalities. All sub-national jurisdictions prohibit smoking in childcare facilities and preschools. 

The provisions of the sub-national legislation align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.","The law generally prohibits smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places.  Therefore, smoking is prohibited in childcare facilities and preschools as these are workplaces for some people and public places for all.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.
","Article 10(a) of Law 19419 prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£any enclosed space that is a place accessible to the public or for shared commercial use, regardless of who the owner may be or who may have the right of access to such place.ÔÇØ This is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in childcare facilities and preschools. In addition, Art. 10(b) lists places where smoking is prohibited in all indoor and outdoor parts of the premises. This list includes ÔÇ£preschools.ÔÇØ Therefore, smoking is prohibited in all childcare facilities and preschools.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to smoking in childcare facilities and preschools.
","The Law on the Protection of Minors provides that no one shall smoke in classrooms, bedrooms, and activity rooms in middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens, childcare facilities, and other places where juveniles collectively participate in activities. The law lists areas in these facilities that are required to be smoke free. This can be interpreted as permitting smoking in the areas in these facilities that are not listed in the law. Some local regulations require both indoor and outdoor areas of childcare facilities/preschools to be smoke free.

The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health jointly issued a document (Opinions on Further Strengthening School Tobacco Control Work, MOE Education Sports Arts Division No. 5 of 2010) requiring indoor and outdoor smoke free environments in primary and middle schools but it is not being implemented.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities/preschools because it does not provide for 100% indoor smoke free environments in those places and, therefore, fails to provide universal and effective protection. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require that all parts of all childcare facilities/preschools to be 100% smoke free. FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 24 provides that Parties have a continuous obligation to remove any exemptions as soon as possible, and each Party should strive to provide universal protection within five years of the WHO Framework ConventionÔÇÖs entry into force for that Party.","The law generally prohibits smoking in all workplaces and public places, and specifically prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£institutions of formal and informal education of all levels,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£public and private entities aimed at any type of . . . service activity,ÔÇØ and ÔÇ£establishments serving minors.ÔÇØ  These provisions encompass child care facilities and preschools. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to child care facilities and preschools. 
","The Tobacco Control Law and its Regulations contain a list of places where smoking is prohibited and that must be 100% smoke free. ÔÇ£Public and private educational and training centersÔÇØ, ÔÇ£centers for social serviceÔÇØ, and ÔÇ£recreational or amusement centers for minorsÔÇØ are on this list. The law is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in childcare facilities and preschools under these provisions. Therefore, childcare facilities and preschools are smoke free.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to smoking in childcare facilities and preschools.
","Article 21c of the Organic Law prohibits smoking in all education facilities and therefore smoking is prohibited in preschools.  Article 21b of the law prohibits smoking in workplaces, places of public service and public access. This provision is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in childcare facilities, as these facilities are both workplaces and public places.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools. However, the law could be clarified by defining ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ and ÔÇ£place of public service.ÔÇØ
","Article 2 of the 2007 Law (which amends the 1981 Law, adding Art. 6 Bis (3)) prohibits smoking in specified public places, namely: ÔÇ£health and educational facilities, governmental venues, sporting and social clubs, youth centers.ÔÇØ  ÔÇ£Educational facilitiesÔÇØ and ÔÇ£youth centersÔÇØ are interpreted to include preschools and childcare facilities, respectively, and therefore smoking is prohibited in these places.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools. ","Childcare facilities and preschools fall into the category of premises that are open to the public and are used as workplaces, and are not expressly listed in the exemptions to the smoking ban. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in childcare facilities and preschools. However, smoking is allowed in a private dwelling when a worker provides personal care for a person living there. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschool. However, as the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines provide, careful consideration should be given to workplaces that are dwellings and workplaces that contain residential areas to ensure that people are protected from tobacco smoke exposure. Therefore, to ensure universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure, the law should require all parts of all workplaces, including those of a residential nature, to be 100% smoke free.","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£institutions for the reception (ÔÇª) or accommodation of minors,ÔÇØ which include childcare facilities and preschools.  In addition, smoking is prohibited in uncovered spaces in public and private schools. Therefore, childcare facilities and preschools are 100% smoke free. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.
","Decree 74-2008 prohibits smoking in virtually all enclosed public places and workplaces (with the limited exception of hotel guestrooms). The definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ in Decree 74-2008 specifically includes education facilities, which would include preschools, and childcare facilities are covered under the can as a place of public access. The regulations to Decree 74-2008 provide that in places where smoking is prohibited air must be 100% smoke free. In addition, Decree 90-97 specifically prohibits smoking in buildings housing preschool and pre-primary education centers.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to childcare facilities and preschools. 
","The law prohibits the consumption of tobacco-derived products, which includes smoked and smokeless tobacco products and e-cigarettes, in all parts of all workplaces and in all public places except for the very limited exceptions of in cigar factories and spaces where tobacco tasting takes place.  Minors, however, are not allowed to enter these facilities where smoking takes place.  Childcare facilities and preschools are considered to be workplaces and/or public places.  In addition, the law specifically bans the consumption of tobacco-derived products in ÔÇ£public and private educational centers.ÔÇØ  Therefore, smoking is banned in childcare facilities/preschools.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities/preschools.","Section 3 of the Smoking Ordinance prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£no smoking areasÔÇØ set forth in Schedule 2.  Schedule 2, Part 1 designates ÔÇ£any child care center,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£any school,ÔÇØ and ÔÇ£any specified educational establishmentÔÇØ as no smoking areas; therefore, childcare facilities and preschools are smoke free.  

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools. ","Smoking is prohibited in the buildings and on the grounds of childcare facilities and preschools. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.
","The law prohibits smoking in many public places including educational institutions and workplaces, and there are no specific exceptions for smoking areas in these places (exceptions are made for airports, and some hotels and restaurants).  G.S.R. 561(E) defines ÔÇ£educational institutionsÔÇØ as ÔÇ£places/centres where educational instructions are imparted according to the specific norms and include schools, colleges and institutions of higher learning established or recognized by an appropriate authority.ÔÇØ  It is not clear, however, whether this definition applies to all aspects of COTPA.  Because the law does not specifically omit childcare facilities/preschools from the law and because the law does ban smoking in educational institutions, we interpret childcare facilities/preschools to be 100% smoke free.  Accordingly, the law and implementing rules align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.","Under the Health Law and Government Regulation (PP) No. 109 of 2012, childrenÔÇÖs play areas and educational facilities are smoke free areas. These provisions are interpreted as prohibiting smoking in childcare facilities and preschools. However, the realization of the ÔÇ£100% smoke freeÔÇØ regulatory status of childcare facilities and preschools depends upon local implementing legislation. The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of the PP requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act, and some local governments have passed legislation while others have not. Because the national law has not been locally implemented in every jurisdiction, childcare facilities and preschools are designated as ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ on a national level, rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke Free.ÔÇØ 
<br>
<br>
The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces, including childcare facilities and preschools, to be 100% smoke free.
","Smoking is prohibited in childcare facilities and preschools.  The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA), Section 47 (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 16) prohibits smoking in a ÔÇ£specified place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes schools and other places of work. Preschools are smoke free as they are schools, and childcare facilities are smoke free as places of work.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.","The law prohibits smoking in kindergartens, childrenÔÇÖs homes, and childrenÔÇÖs houses.  In addition, the law generally prohibits smoking in buildings serving as education institutions or institutions of higher learning.  However, the law permits smoking in designated rooms in certain educational facilities, although these places do not include childcare facilities and preschools.  

Although the law generally permits designated smoking rooms in workplaces, the definition of ÔÇ£place of workÔÇØ specifically requires that the place does not serve for residential purposes.  Therefore, even if childcare is provided within someoneÔÇÖs home, it is likely that a separate area may not be set aside for smoking even though it serves as a workplace for some because the premises would most likely be considered a ÔÇ£place of workÔÇØ under the law.

Together, these provisions prohibit smoking in all childcare facilities and preschools. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to childcare facilities and preschools.
","The regulations prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places without exception.  The Second Schedule includes a non-exhaustive list of places where smoking is prohibited, and specifically includes educational institutions and areas specifically for use by children.  In addition, the definition of ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ specifically includes residences used for commercially-operated childcare activities. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in preschools and childcare facilities.  The ban on smoking in these places extends to cover using or holding an electronic tobacco product.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to preschools and childcare facilities.","Article 25 of the Health Promotion Act asks managers of certain enumerated public places, including ÔÇ£schoolsÔÇØ to ÔÇ£try to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent passive smoking exposure.ÔÇØ HSB Notification 0025 advises prefectural governors on implementation of Article 25. This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£it is especially necessary to consider passive smoking prevention measures in public spaces that may be used by children, even if those spaces are outdoors.ÔÇØ However, the notification stops short of requiring childcare facilities and preschools to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the law is not obligatory in nature and does not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in childcare facilities and preschools, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many childcare facilities and preschools ban or restrict indoor smoking. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in childcare facilities and preschools.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free childcare facilities and preschools and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of childcare facilities and preschools to be 100% smoke free.
","The law prohibits smoking in all ÔÇ£nurseries and kindergartens in both public and private sectorsÔÇØ. This is interpreted as including all childcare facilities and preschools.

Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to universities/vocational facilities because it does not provide for 100% indoor smoke free environments in these places and, therefore, does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces, including universities and vocational facilities, to be 100% smoke free.
","Smoking is prohibited in universities and vocational facilities, except in rooms used solely for living accommodation.  The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA), Section 47 (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 16) prohibits smoking in a ÔÇ£specified place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes a school or college. However, Section 47(7) exempts rooms used solely for living accommodation in a higher educational institution. Therefore the status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given.

This provision does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for a 100% smoke free indoor environment in universities and vocational facilities and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

Any designated smoking room must have appropriate ventilation and must not serve as a nuisance to other parts of the location.  

Note that management and staff rooms are subject to the requirements set forth in Section 15 of the Addendum, which governs workplaces.  Section 15 permits smoking in designated rooms in workplaces.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it permits designated smoking rooms in universities and other post-secondary educational facilities.

However, the notification stops short of requiring public spaces, including universities and vocational facilities, to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the laws are not obligatory in nature and do not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in universities and vocational facilities, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many universities and vocational facilities ban or restrict indoor smoking.  In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in universities and vocational facilities.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free universities and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of universities to be 100% smoke free.

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces, including universities and vocational facilities.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places, including universities and vocational facilities, and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","Smoking is prohibited in most public areas or work environments, including educational facilities.

The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given.

However, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards. In practice, smoking areas are allowed inside public places and workplaces notwithstanding the no-transfer of particulates rule. 

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8.

","Article 25 of the Health Promotion Act asks managers of certain enumerated public places, including ÔÇ£department storesÔÇØ and ÔÇ£other facilities used by numerous peopleÔÇØ, to ÔÇ£try to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent passive smoking exposure.ÔÇØ HSB Notification 0025 advises prefectural governors on implementation of Article 25. This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£other facilitiesÔÇØ includes all ÔÇ£shopsÔÇØ. However, the notification stops short of requiring shops to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the laws  are not obligatory in nature and do not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in shops, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessary"". Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many shops ban or restrict indoor smoking. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in shops.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free shops and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of shops to be 100% smoke free.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ, the definition of which includes a list of places, ÔÇ£non-governmental placesÔÇØ and ÔÇ£any other place deemed by the Minister as public, provided that his decision is published in the Gazette.ÔÇØ ÔÇ£ShopsÔÇØ are considered non-governmental places and the Minister of Health issued a letter to the General Manager of the Amman Mall requesting him to implement the smoking ban in the mall. Other shops are not mentioned in this letter; however, the phrase ÔÇ£non-governmental placesÔÇØ is interpreted to mean all shops and therefore the regulatory status ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 
<br><br>
However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law and implementing instructions has been inconsistent.  
<br><br>
Although shops are currently smoke free under the law, to fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas in public places. In addition, to clarify the scope of the ban and aid in enforcement, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.
","Section 33(2) gives an extensive list of public places and workplaces in which smoking is permitted in specially designated areas. The list includes ÔÇ£markets, shopping malls and retail and wholesale establishments.ÔÇØ 

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places, including stores, and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","Smoking is prohibited in most public areas and work environments, including shops. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to shops.","The law prohibits smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces. The definition of ÔÇ£enclosed public placeÔÇØ includes any place ÔÇ£open to the publicÔÇØ and provides an exemplary, non-exhaustive, list of places that are ÔÇ£public places,ÔÇØ which specifically includes ÔÇ£shopping malls.ÔÇØ  Smoking is prohibited in other types of shops under the ban on smoking in ÔÇ£workplaces,ÔÇØ as shops are workplaces. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in all shops and stores.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to shops and stores.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£large shopping malls, shopping centers, supermarkets, markets and stores.ÔÇØ  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to stores or shops.","There is a comprehensive ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces, indoor public places, and public transport.  Therefore, shops are 100% smoke free.  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to shops.","The regulations prohibit smoking in ÔÇ£any area of a shopping complexÔÇØ and in any air-conditioned shop. However, the regulations do not prohibit smoking in a non air-conditioned shop. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is assigned.

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all shops and stores, including in non air-conditioned shops.
","Article 14 of the law states that it is prohibited for any person to expose another person to tobacco smoke outside places reserved for smokers. Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 

While this interpretation of the legislation aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, a future decree should clarify requirements under Articles 14 and 15 to ensure that smoking is clearly prohibited in all shops. 
","The Public Health Regulations prohibit smoking in a ÔÇ£public place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes ÔÇ£any indoor area which is open to the public or any part of the public.ÔÇØ  Thus smoking is prohibited in stores, as indoor areas open to the public.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to shops.","The law provides that places with public access (public places) and interior public or private work areas (workplaces), other than primary and secondary schools, may provide isolated indoor areas exclusively for smoking. Although the law provides that these areas must be either in the open air or in isolated interior spaces, the regulations do not restrict them to open areas only. Therefore, stores/shops may set up isolated indoor smoking areas, provided they use mechanisms that avoid the transfer of particulates to non-smoking areas, they are not mandatory pass-through areas for non-smokers, and they meet the isolation, ventilation and purification specifications of RGLTC Arts. 60, 61, and 63. 

However, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards. In practice, smoking areas are allowed inside public places and workplaces notwithstanding the no-transfer of particulates rule. 

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8. Therefore, to align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should completely ban smoking in all indoor public places, workplaces, and all means of public transport.","The law comprehensively prohibits smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces without exception.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to stores or shops.  

","The Tobacco Products Act prohibits smoking in a specified list of public places, which includes ÔÇ£department store and mini-market.ÔÇØ Although the law is unclear as to what qualifies as a department store or mini-market because these terms are not defined, the intent of the law appears to be to prohibit smoking in all stores and shops. Therefore, the law is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in all stores and shops.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to shops and stores.
","The law prohibits smoking in workplaces, with a few limited exceptions that do not apply to stores and shops. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in stores and shops, as they are workplaces for some.

","The law and decree allow a person in control of a public place or workplace, which includes any ÔÇ£closed and covered places which are open to the public,ÔÇØ to create designated smoking rooms. Designated smoking rooms are subject to design restrictions provided in the decree. Therefore, smoking in shops is not prohibited. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law and decree should prohibit smoking in all parts of all indoor workplaces and public places, including shops. 

","Shops fall into the category of premises that are open to the public and are used as a workplace, and are not expressly listed as exemptions to the smoking ban. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in shops. However, there is an exemption for special tobacconists, wherein smoking is permitted by persons sampling cigars and pipe tobacco.  The sampling room must be completely enclosed, separately ventilated, with a mechanically closing door, and signed as a smoking area. 

Given the limited exemption, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given for shops rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke Free.ÔÇØ FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines para. 24 provides that Parties have a continuous obligation to remove any exemptions as soon as possible, and each Party should strive to provide universal protection within five years of the WHO Framework ConventionÔÇÖs entry into force for that Party.
","The Act provides that: ÔÇ£If several premises within a certain area are used for the same purpose, smoking may be permitted in up to one-half of these premises.ÔÇØ  Under this provision, smoking is permitted in designated smoking rooms in stores (provided the store is comprised of more than one room).

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£place[s] of public work or use,ÔÇØ which is defined as places included on the lists contained in the Ordinance or SRO ÔÇ£and the like which are visited by the general public.ÔÇØ Although ÔÇ£storesÔÇØ do not appear on either list, the catchall ÔÇ£and the like which are visited by the general publicÔÇØ is interpreted to include stores.

The law allows the government to issue guidelines for designated smoking areas in public places included on the lists. Such guidelines were issued and later rescinded in the interest of protecting public health.  Therefore, public places included on the lists are currently smoke free.  

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free environments in all indoor workplaces and public places, and allows for future designated smoking areas.  The law therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

In addition, the law specifically bans the consumption of tobacco-derived products in ÔÇ£centers designed for entertainment, sports, and culture.ÔÇØ  Therefore, smoking is banned in cultural facilities.
The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.","Section 3 of the Smoking Ordinance prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£no smoking areasÔÇØ set forth in Schedule 2.  Schedule 2 does not specifically address cultural institutions.  However, Schedule 2, Part 1 includes a catch-all provision that designates as non-smoking any ÔÇ£indoor area in a workplace or public place to the extent that it is not an area described in any other item in this Part.ÔÇØ  This provision covers indoor cultural institutions and they are, therefore, smoke free.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities. ","Smoking is prohibited in ÔÇ£service areasÔÇØ of public places. A service area includes, by definition, any area under a roof to which the public has access for participation in cultural events. However, Art. 8 of the Act provides an exemption that permits designated smoking areas for employees in areas to which the public does not have access. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in public areas (service areas) of cultural facilities but permitted by employees in areas of cultural facilities to which the public does not have access.

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all parts of cultural facilities.
","The law prohibits smoking in many public places including auditoriums, amusement centers, libraries, workplaces, and places visited by the general public, and there are no specific exceptions for smoking areas in these places. (Exceptions are made for airports, and some hotels and restaurants). Although the definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ does not explicitly include cultural facilities, we consider such facilities as ÔÇ£places visited by the general public.ÔÇØ  Cultural facilities accordingly would fall within the definition of public places and must be smoke free. 

Because the law provides for 100% smoke free cultural facilities, the law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines. ","The law and a Constitutional Court ruling require smoking areas in workplaces and public places. (Smoking areas, however, may be located outside pursuant to government guidelines.) Accordingly, a cultural facility, as a public place and workplace, must have either an indoor or outdoor smoking area. The ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ regulatory status results from (1) inconsistencies regarding the smoke free status of public places and workplaces (some cultural facilities are smoke free because the smoking area is outdoors while other cultural facilities are not smoke free because of indoor smoking areas) and (2) the fact that smoke free status depends upon local implementing legislation. The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of Government Regulation (PP) 109 of 2012 requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act. Some local governments have passed legislation requiring designated smoking areas indoors, others have passed legislation requiring 100% smoke free indoor public places (including cultural facilities) with smoking areas outside, while many others have not passed any legislation. Thus, cultural facilities are designated as ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ because of the varying regulatory schemes across sub-national jurisdictions. 
<br>
<br>
The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.
","Smoking is prohibited in cultural facilities.  The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA), Section 47 (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 16) prohibits smoking in a ÔÇ£specified place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes a ÔÇ£place of work,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£a cinema, theatre, concert hall or other place normally used for indoor public entertainment, insofar as it is a place of work,ÔÇØ and government owned or occupied buildings. Therefore, cultural facilities that are cinemas, theaters, concert halls, or other place of entertainments, and cultural facilities owned or occupied by the government are smoke free. Other cultural facilities not listed are smoke free as a place of work.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.","The law prohibits smoking entirely in several types of cultural facilities and restricts smoking in several others. Smoking is prohibited entirely in ÔÇ£any place in a building of a culture . . . or of a youth movement,ÔÇØ and pursuant to a December 2012 court decision, smoking is prohibited by actors on stage during a performance.  The law permits designated smoking rooms to be set aside in cinemas, theaters, and conference facilities during performance intermissions; banqueting halls; and events parks, provided that the total area set aside for smoking does not exceed one fourth of the area open to the public in any of these places. In addition, designated smoking places or areas are permitted in reading halls or reading rooms in public libraries. Any designated smoking room must have appropriate ventilation and must not serve as a nuisance to other parts of the location.  

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all types of cultural facilities.
","The regulations prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places without exception.  The Second Schedule includes a non-exhaustive list of places where smoking is prohibited, and although cultural facilities are not specifically listed, they are covered under the smoking ban as public places and workplaces.  The ban on smoking in these places extends to cover using or holding an electronic tobacco product.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.
","Article 25 of the Health Promotion Act asks managers of certain enumerated public places, including ÔÇ£theatres, public assembly halls, gallery spacesÔÇØ and ÔÇ£other facilities used by numerous peopleÔÇØ, to ÔÇ£try to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent passive smoking exposure.ÔÇØ HSB Notification 0025 advises prefectural governors on implementation of Article 25. This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£other facilitiesÔÇØ includes all ÔÇ£museumsÔÇØ and ÔÇ£entertainment facilitiesÔÇØ. Thus, many cultural facilities are covered by the law and notification. However, the notification stops short of requiring cultural facilities to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the laws is not obligatory in nature and do not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in cultural facilities, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many cultural facilities ban or restrict indoor smoking. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in cultural facilities.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free cultural facilities and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of cultural facilities to be 100% smoke free.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ, which by definition includes ÔÇ£cinemas, theatres, public libraries, museumsÔÇØ. This is interpreted as covering all cultural facilities. Although the law authorizes the Minister of Health to allow designated smoking areas in public places, the Minister has not done so with respect to cultural facilities as of the date of this review. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in cultural facilities. 
<br><br>
However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law has been inconsistent. 
<br><br>
Although cultural facilities are currently smoke free under the law, to fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas in public places. In addition, to clarify the scope of the ban and aid in enforcement, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.
","Section 33(2) gives an extensive list of public places and workplaces in which smoking is permitted in specially designated areas. The list includes ÔÇ£cinema halls, theatres, video houses, such other halls or places of performance, disco halls or any other entertainment facilities.  . . .ÔÇØ  The list also includes ÔÇ£public buildings,ÔÇØ which encompasses non-performance space cultural facilities such as museums, exhibition halls and libraries.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places, including cultural facilities, and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","Smoking is prohibited in most public areas and work environments, including cultural facilities. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.","The law prohibits smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces. The definition of ÔÇ£enclosed public placeÔÇØ includes any place ÔÇ£open to the publicÔÇØ and provides an exemplary, non-exhaustive, list of places that are ÔÇ£public places,ÔÇØ which specifically includes cinemas and theaters.  Smoking in other types of cultural facilities is prohibited as places ÔÇ£open to the publicÔÇØ and ÔÇ£work places.ÔÇØ Therefore, the law is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in all cultural facilities.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£museums, open collections, cultural centers, archives, libraries, conference halls, reading rooms and exhibition hallsÔÇØ and ÔÇ£cinemas, theaters, facilities for public spectacles and other places intended for the presentation of arts and shows.ÔÇØ These provisions are interpreted as prohibiting smoking in all cultural facilities. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.","There is a comprehensive ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces, indoor public places, and public transport.  Therefore, cultural facilities are 100% smoke free.  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to cultural facilities.","The regulations prohibit smoking in any entertainment center, theatre, library, and in ÔÇ£any area of a government premisesÔÇØ.  With respect to libraries and government premises, this includes the area inside the building and the surrounding area up to the borders of the fence or lot. These categories cover virtually all cultural facilities. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is assigned. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.","Article 14 of the law states that it is prohibited for any person to expose another person to tobacco smoke outside places reserved for smokers. Article 15 of the law prohibits smoking in a list of places, including movie theatres, but states that designated smoking areas may be set up in some of those places. Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 

While this interpretation of the legislation aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, a future decree should clarify requirements under Articles 14 and 15 to ensure that smoking is clearly prohibited in all cultural facilities.
","The Public Health Regulations prohibit smoking in a ÔÇ£public place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes ÔÇ£any indoor area which is open to the public or any part of the public.ÔÇØ  Thus, smoking is prohibited in cultural facilities, as indoor areas open to the public.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to cultural facilities.","The law provides that places with public access (public places) and interior public or private work areas (workplaces), other than primary and secondary schools, may provide isolated indoor areas exclusively for smoking. Although the law provides that these areas must be either in the open air or in isolated interior spaces, the regulations do not require them to be in open areas. Therefore, cultural facilities may set up isolated indoor smoking areas, provided they use mechanisms that avoid the transfer of particulates to non-smoking areas, they are not mandatory pass-through areas for non-smokers, and they meet the isolation, ventilation, and purification specifications of RGLTC Arts. 60, 61, and 63. 

However, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards. In practice, smoking areas are allowed inside public places and workplaces notwithstanding the no-transfer of particulates rule. 

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8. Therefore, to align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should completely ban smoking in all indoor public places, workplaces, and all means of public transport.","The law comprehensively prohibits smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces without exception. The terms ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ and ÔÇ£workplaceÔÇØ are broadly defined to include cultural facilities. Therefore, these places are covered under the ban.

The law allows the government to issue guidelines for designated smoking areas in public places included on the lists. Such guidelines were issued and later rescinded in the interest of protecting public health.  Therefore, public places included on the lists are currently smoke free.  

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free environments in all indoor workplaces and public places, and allows for future designated smoking areas.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.
","Smoking restrictions in workplaces and public places, including indoor stadiums and arenas, generally fall under the jurisdiction of the provinces, territories, and municipalities. All sub-national jurisdictions prohibit smoking in indoor stadiums and arenas. 

The provisions of the sub-national legislation align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.","The law generally prohibits smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places and specifically prohibits smoking in stadiums. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in stadiums. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums/arenas.
","Article 10(a) of Law 19419 prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£any enclosed space that is a place accessible to the public or for shared commercial use, regardless of who the owner may be or who may have the right of access to such place.ÔÇØ This is interpreted as prohibiting smoking in indoor stadiums and arenas. In addition, Art. 10(b) lists places where smoking is prohibited in all indoor and outdoor parts of the premises. This list includes ÔÇ£galleries, platforms and other spaces intended for the public in athletic facilities, gymnasiums or stadiums. This prohibition extends to the playing field and to the entire area encompassed within the perimeter consisting of such galleries, platforms and other spaces, except in places where smoking is specially authorized that may be included in such premises.ÔÇØ The last clause of this provision, allowing smoking in specially authorized places, is interpreted as allowing designated smoking areas in outdoor areas, not indoor areas, as the general prohibition against smoking indoors (Art. 10(a)) applies. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in indoor stadiums and arenas. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to smoking in indoor stadiums and arenas.
","The MOH Implementation Rules, read in conjunction with the State Council Regulations, prohibit smoking in public places, including specifically sport stadiums. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor sports stadiums.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to stadiums and arenas.
","The Tobacco Control Law and its Regulations contain a list of places where smoking is prohibited and that must be 100% smoke free.

The Regulations provide further explanation, stating: ÔÇ£Included are all areas involved in activities with massive concentrations of people, holiday gatherings, parties, and the like, and parks in general.ÔÇØ Because in indoor stadiums and arenas are places where athletic events, spectacles (defined in the Regulations), recreational activities, and activities with massive concentrations (defined in the Regulations) of people occur, indoor stadiums and arenas are smoke free.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to smoking in indoor stadiums and arenas.
","The law prohibits smoking in indoor places for sports activities and in ÔÇ£all enclosed spaces that are workplaces, places for public service and of public access.ÔÇØ  Therefore, smoking is prohibited in indoor stadiums and arenas, as these are often used for sports activities and are also workplaces and places of public access.  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.","Article 2 of the 2007 Law (which amends the 1981 Law, adding Art. 6 Bis (3)) prohibits smoking in specified public places, namely: ÔÇ£health and educational facilities, governmental venues, sporting and social clubs, youth centers.ÔÇØ  Stadiums are not included on this list and therefore smoking is not restricted.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for a 100% smoke free environment in all indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","Indoor stadiums and arenas fall into the category of premises that are open to the public and are used as workplaces, and are not expressly listed in the exemptions to the smoking ban. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in indoor stadium and arenas.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.
","The law prohibits smoking in indoor public places and workplaces, including indoor stadiums and arenas.  However, the law makes an exception for smoking in designated areas expressly reserved for smokers. The law states that the owner or manager of an indoor public place or workplace can designate separate rooms as smoking areas, subject to certain technical standards.  Although pursuant to the law, certain public places may not contain smoking zones, indoor stadiums and arenas are not one of these places. 
<br><br>
The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines due to the fact that it provides for the designation of smoking areas. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free. 
","Decree 74-2008 prohibits smoking in virtually all enclosed public places and workplaces (with the limited exception of hotel guestrooms), and therefore smoking is prohibited in indoor stadiums or arenas. In addition, the regulations to Decree 74-2008 provide that in places where smoking is prohibited air must be 100% smoke free. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with regard to indoor stadiums or arenas.  
","The law prohibits the consumption of tobacco-derived products, which includes smoked and smokeless tobacco products and e-cigarettes, in all parts of all workplaces and in all public places except for the very limited exceptions of in cigar factories and spaces where tobacco tasting takes place.  Minors, however, are not allowed to enter these facilities where smoking takes place.  Indoor stadiums and arenas are considered to be workplaces and/or public places.  In addition, the law specifically bans the consumption of tobacco-derived products in ÔÇ£centers designed for entertainment, sports, and culture.ÔÇØ  Therefore, smoking is banned in indoor stadiums and arenas.
The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.","Section 3 of the Smoking Ordinance prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£no smoking areasÔÇØ set forth in Schedule 2.  Schedule 2, Part 1 designates the following areas in stadiums as smoke free: any pitch, any running track, any sidewalk immediately adjacent to the pitch or running track, and any spectator stand. In addition, Schedule 2, Part 1 includes a catch-all provision that designates as non-smoking any ÔÇ£indoor area in a workplace or public place to the extent that it is not an area described in any other item in this Part.ÔÇØ  Together, these provisions are interpreted as prohibiting smoking in all parts of all indoor stadiums and arenas.
The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums/arenas. 
","Smoking is prohibited in ÔÇ£service areasÔÇØ of public places, including places where sports activities take place. A service area includes, by definition, any area under a roof to which the public has access for commerce or provision of a service, including spectator areas. However, Art. 8 of the Act provides an exemption that permits designated smoking areas for employees in areas to which the public does not have access. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in spectator areas (service areas) of indoor stadiums and areas, but permitted by employees in areas of the stadium/arena to which the public does not have access.

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all parts of indoor stadiums and arenas.","The law prohibits smoking in many public places including auditoriums and places to which the public have access, and there are no specific exceptions for smoking areas in these places (exceptions are made for airports, and some hotels and restaurants).  Although the law does not specifically address indoor stadiums/arenas, we interpret them to be 100% smoke free.  Accordingly, the law and implementing rules align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.","The law and a Constitutional Court ruling require smoking areas in workplaces and public places. (Smoking areas, however, may be located outside pursuant to government guidelines.) Accordingly, an indoor stadium or arena, as a public place and workplace, must have either an indoor or outdoor smoking area. The ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ regulatory status results from (1) inconsistencies regarding the smoke free status of public places and workplaces (some indoor stadiums are smoke free because the smoking area is outdoors while other indoor stadiums are not smoke free because of indoor smoking areas) and (2) the fact that smoke free status depends upon local implementing legislation. The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of Government Regulation (PP) 109 of 2012 requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act. Some local governments have passed legislation requiring designated smoking areas indoors, others have passed legislation requiring 100% smoke free indoor public places (including indoor stadiums and arenas) with smoking areas outside, while many others have not passed any legislation. Thus, indoor stadiums and arenas are designated as ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ because of the varying regulatory schemes across sub-national jurisdictions. 
<br>
<br>
The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces, including indoor stadiums and arenas, to be 100% smoke free.","Smoking is prohibited in indoor stadiums and arenas.  The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA), Section 47 (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 16) prohibits smoking in a ÔÇ£specified place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes a ÔÇ£place of work.ÔÇØ An indoor stadium or arena, as a place of work, is therefore smoke free.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£a room or hallÔÇØ that is open to the public for physical activity or sport. This also includes indoor swimming pools.  However, the law permits designated smoking rooms to be set aside in ÔÇ£events parks.ÔÇØ  Because no definition of ÔÇ£events parksÔÇØ is provided, it is difficult to determine whether these are indoor or outdoor facilities.  As a result, it is uncertain whether all indoor stadiums and arenas are covered under the law.  Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£UncertainÔÇØ is assigned.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.
","The regulations prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places without exception.  The Second Schedule includes a non-exhaustive list of places where smoking is prohibited, and specifically includes sports, athletic, and other similar facilities for use by the public.  Therefore, smoking is prohibited in indoor stadiums and arenas.  The ban on smoking in these places extends to cover using or holding an electronic tobacco product.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.
","Article 25 of the Health Promotion Act asks managers of certain enumerated public places, including ÔÇ£public assembly hallsÔÇØ and ÔÇ£other facilities used by numerous peopleÔÇØ, to ÔÇ£try to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent passive smoking exposure.ÔÇØ HSB Notification 0025 advises prefectural governors on implementation of Article 25. This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£other facilitiesÔÇØ includes all ÔÇ£entertainment facilitiesÔÇØ and ÔÇ£outdoor stadiumsÔÇØ. The broad categories in the law and notification are interpreted as including ÔÇ£indoor stadiums and arenasÔÇØ (especially in light of the inclusion of outdoor stadiums). However, the notification stops short of requiring indoor stadiums and arenas to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the laws is not obligatory in nature and do not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in indoor stadiums and arenas, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many indoor stadiums and arenas ban or restrict indoor smoking. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in indoor stadiums.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor stadiums and arenas and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of indoor stadiums and arenas to be 100% smoke free.
","The law prohibits smoking in ÔÇ£public placesÔÇØ, which by definition includes ÔÇ£enclosed stadiumsÔÇØ. Although the law authorizes the Minister to allow designated smoking areas in public places, the Minister has not done so with respect to enclosed stadiums as of the date of this review. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in enclosed stadiums/arenas. 
<br><br>
However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law has been inconsistent. 
<br><br>
Although enclosed stadiums/arenas are currently smoke free under the law, to fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas in public places. In addition, to clarify the scope of the ban and aid in enforcement, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","Smoking is prohibited in most public areas and work environments, including all sports or recreation facilities.

The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given. 

While this interpretation of the legislation aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, a future decree should clarify requirements under Articles 14 and 15 to ensure that smoking is clearly prohibited in all indoor stadiums and arenas.
","The Public Health Regulations prohibit smoking in a ÔÇ£public place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes ÔÇ£any indoor area which is open to the public or any part of the public.ÔÇØ  Thus, smoking is prohibited in indoor stadiums and arenas, as indoor areas open to the public.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to indoor stadiums and arenas.","The law provides that places with public access (public places) and interior public or private work areas (workplaces), other than primary and secondary schools, may provide isolated indoor areas exclusively for smoking. Although the law provides that these areas must be either in the open air or in isolated interior spaces, the regulations do not require them to be in open areas. Therefore, indoor stadiums/arenas may set up isolated indoor smoking areas, provided they use mechanisms that avoid the transfer of particulates to non-smoking areas, they are not mandatory pass-through areas for non-smokers, and they meet the isolation, ventilation, and purification specifications of RGLTC Arts. 60, 61, and 63. 

As a matter of fact, however, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards. In practice, smoking areas are allowed inside public places and workplaces notwithstanding the no-transfer of particulates rule. 

The FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8. Therefore, to align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should completely ban smoking in all indoor public places, workplaces, and all means of public transport.","The law comprehensively prohibits smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces without exception.

Moreover, the smoking ban does not apply to restaurants that have fewer than four walls.  
The law does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor restaurants. Therefore, the law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines and, accordingly, does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor restaurants to be 100% smoke free.  In addition, a definition of ÔÇ£indoorÔÇØ or ÔÇ£enclosedÔÇØ should be provided in accordance with the definition provided in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines to ensure that restaurants with fewer than four walls are covered.

The First Schedule of the regulations (as amended in 2012) lists ""eating place including any toilet within the boundaries thereof"" and ""restaurant . . . in any private club"" as places where smoking is prohibited. ""Eating place"" is defined as ""any place or any part of the place where food, meals or refreshments are served to the public and includes a ballroom of a hotel."" Therefore, smoking is prohibited in all restaurants.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for a 100% smoke free environment in all indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free.","Restaurants fall into the category of premises that are open to the public and are used as workplaces, and are not expressly listed in the exemptions to the smoking ban.

In places of socialization such as restaurants, the prohibition applies to any enclosed covered space, even if the fa├ºade is removable.

However, the law makes an exception for smoking in designated areas expressly reserved for smokers.  The law states that the owner or manager of an indoor public place or workplace can designate separate rooms as smoking areas, subject to certain technical standards.  Service is not permitted in the designated smoking rooms.  Although pursuant to the law, certain public places may not contain smoking zones, restaurants are not one of these places.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines due to the fact that it provides for the designation of smoking areas. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces to be 100% smoke free. 
","Decree 74-2008 prohibits smoking in virtually all enclosed public places and workplaces (with the limited exception of hotel guestrooms). The definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ under Decree 74-2008 includes restaurants, and therefore smoking is prohibited in restaurants under this decree. Decree 74-2008 defines restaurants to cover coffee shops and any establishment where food is given or offered for sale to the public or employees. The regulations to Decree 74-2008 provide that in places where smoking is prohibited air must be 100% smoke free. 

Decree 90-97 also prohibits smoking in restaurants. Although previously smoking areas were required, Decree 74-2008 (Art. 8) repealed the provision of Decree 90-97 (Art. 51b) that required designated smoking areas in places that sell food.

","The law prohibits the consumption of tobacco-derived products, which includes smoked and smokeless tobacco products and e-cigarettes, in all parts of all workplaces and in all public places except for the very limited exceptions of in cigar factories and spaces where tobacco tasting takes place.  Minors, however, are not allowed to enter these facilities where smoking takes place.  Restaurants are considered to be workplaces and/or public places.  In addition, the law specifically bans the consumption of tobacco-derived products in establishments designed for entertainment, which encompasses restaurants.  Therefore, smoking is banned in restaurants.

A service area includes, by definition, any area under a roof to which the public has access for commerce or provision of a service. However, Art. 8 of the Act provides an exemption that permits designated smoking areas for employees in areas to which the public does not have access. Therefore, smoking is prohibited in service areas of restaurants, but permitted by employees in areas of the restaurant to which the public does not have access.

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all parts of restaurants.
","The law prohibits smoking in many public places including restaurants.  The law further provides, however, that in restaurants having a seating capacity of 30 persons or more, a separate provision for a smoking area or space may be made.

Because the law does not provide for 100% smoke free restaurants, the law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.  To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all restaurants to be 100% smoke free. ","The law and a Constitutional Court ruling require smoking areas in workplaces and public places. (Smoking areas, however, may be located outside pursuant to government guidelines.) Accordingly, a restaurant, as a public place and workplace, must have either an indoor or outdoor smoking area. The ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ regulatory status results from (1) inconsistencies regarding the smoke free status of public places and workplaces (some restaurants are smoke free because the smoking area is outdoors while other restaurants are not smoke free because of indoor smoking areas) and (2) the fact that smoke free status depends upon local implementing legislation. The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of Government Regulation (PP) 109 of 2012 requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act. Some local governments have passed legislation requiring designated smoking areas indoors, others have passed legislation requiring 100% smoke free indoor public places (including restaurants) with smoking areas outside, while many others have not passed any legislation. Thus, restaurants are designated as ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ because of the varying regulatory schemes across sub-national jurisdictions.

<br>
The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all indoor public places and workplaces, including restaurants, to be 100% smoke free.
","Smoking is prohibited in restaurants.  The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA), Section 47 (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 16) prohibits smoking in a ÔÇ£specified place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes a ÔÇ£place of work,ÔÇØ and ÔÇ£a licensed premises, insofar as it is a place of work.ÔÇØ  A restaurant, as a licensed premises and a place of work, is therefore smoke free.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to restaurants.","The law restricts smoking to designated smoking rooms in restaurants and similar eating places (e.g., cafeterias, coffee shops). The area allocated for smoking may not exceed one fourth of the area open to the public.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to restaurants. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all parts of restaurants.  
","The regulations prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces and public places without exception.

This notification clarifies that ÔÇ£as a general rule public spaces that are used by a large number of people should be entirely non-smokingÔÇØ. However, the notification stops short of requiring public places, including restaurants, to be entirely non-smoking and permits ÔÇ£appropriate passive smoking prevention measuresÔÇØ in places ÔÇ£where it is difficult to ban smoking entirelyÔÇØ; thereby allowing designated smoking areas or no action at all.

At the national level, the language of the laws is not obligatory in nature and do not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in restaurants, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many restaurants ban or restrict indoor smoking. 
In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in restaurants.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor restaurants and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all areas of restaurants to be 100% smoke free.

The Ministry of Health has also issued a letter to the Restaurant Association requiring fast food restaurants to be 100% smoke free.
<br><br>
However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law has been inconsistent. 
<br><br>
To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces, including all parts of all restaurants with no designated smoking areas. The law should not authorize the Minister to permit designated smoking areas in public places. In addition, to clarify the scope of the ban and aid in enforcement, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£public placeÔÇØ in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines.

To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should prohibit smoking in all indoor areas of all restaurants.
","Article 14 of the law states that it is prohibited for any person to expose another person to tobacco smoke outside places reserved for smokers. Further, the law must be implemented by a decree. 
 
The only decree issued to date establishes designated smoking areas in airports only and in no other place. Therefore, the law is interpreted to prohibit smoking in all other places outside the exception specified in the decree and the regulatory status code ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ is given.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to restaurants.","The law provides that places with public access (public places) and interior public or private work areas (workplaces), other than primary and secondary schools, may provide isolated areas exclusively for smoking. Although the law provides that these areas must be either in the open air or in isolated interior spaces, the regulations do not require them to be in open areas. Therefore, restaurants may set up isolated indoor smoking areas, provided they use mechanisms that avoid the transfer of particulates to non-smoking areas, they are not mandatory pass-through areas for non-smokers, and they meet the isolation, ventilation, and purification specifications of RGLTC Arts. 60, 61, and 63. 

However, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards. In practice, smoking areas are allowed inside public places and workplaces notwithstanding the no-transfer of particulates rule. 

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8. Therefore, to align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should completely ban smoking in all indoor public places, workplaces, and all means of public transport.","The law comprehensively prohibits smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces without exception.

For this reason, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given, rather than ÔÇ£100% Smoke Free.ÔÇØ 

The sub-national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not require 100% indoor smoke free workplaces and public places and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

At the national level, the language of the laws do not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in bars and nightclubs, but rather ÔÇ£to try to take whatever steps are necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many bars and nightclubs ban or restrict indoor smoking. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in bars and nightclubs.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor bars and nightclubs and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

However, it should be noted that it is not possible to prevent the transfer of particulates from smoking areas to non-smoking areas, even with the most rigorous ventilation standards.

FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines paras. 23 and 24 make it clear that only 100% smoke free indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport provide effective protection, as required by FCTC Art. 8.

Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, many hotels and other lodging facilities ban or restrict smoking in guest rooms. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in guest rooms of hotels and other lodging facilities.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free hotels and other lodging facilities and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

The smoking zones, in turn, are subject to restrictions provided in the 2006 Rules, which prohibit smoking zones in any public vehicle with a single compartment. Although the prohibition on smoking zones may be applicable to buses as they usually have only one car, it most likely will not affect trains as they usually have multiple cars.

For transport of people, they refer to road transport (http://www.antt.gov.br/passageiro/apresentacaopas.asp).  

A decree permits smoking in designated smoking sections of aircraft and public vehicles for transportation of one hour or more in duration. The decree cannot reduce or alter the coverage of the law. Accordingly, the law should prevail and, if trains are considered a vehicle of transportation, smoking should be prohibited on all vehicles of public transportation, including trains, regardless of their scheduled transport duration. In practice, smoking is not common on trains.

This exemption does not apply to the three main franchise bus operators ÔÇô KMB, Citibus, and New World Group. This provision fails to provide protection to bus and taxi drivers and non-smoking passengers in these circumstances.

The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces, public places, and public transport, and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

At the national level, the language of the law is not obligatory and does not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in trains, buses and other shared ground transportation, but rather ÔÇ£to tryÔÇØ to take measures ÔÇ£as necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, nearly all forms of public transport, including trains, buses and other shared ground transportation, ban or place restrictions on smoking. In addition, prefectural or city ordinances may prohibit or restrict smoking in shared ground transportation.

","Under the law, smoking is prohibited in aircraft and vehicles of public transportation. However, a decree permits smoking in designated smoking areas of aircraft and public vehicles for transportation lasting one hour or more in duration. The decree cannot reduce or alter the coverage of the law. Accordingly, the law should prevail and smoking should be prohibited on all aircraft regardless of their scheduled transport duration. 

To align with the FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, all applicable laws should consistently prohibit smoking on all means of public transportation, including aircraft. 
","The law states that the Health Minister may specify any ""public service vehicle"" as a vehicle in which smoking is not permitted. The Second Schedule of the 2007 regulations lists public service vehicles in which smoking is prohibited, as follows: any motor omnibus (defined as a public service vehicle that can carry 7 or more passengers), any private bus, any private hire bus, any school bus, any taxicab (defined as a motor vehicle licensed to carry not more than 6 passengers). The schedule does not address commercial aircraft. However, Royal Brunei airlines has a policy prohibiting smoking on all international and regional flights. The use of e-cigarettes is also prohibited.  http://www.flyroyalbrunei.com/australia/travel-info/regulations-passenger-info/.  Other airlines that fly into Brunei have similar policies.

To fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8  Guidelines, the law should specifically state that smoking is prohibited on all commercial aircraft.

","The MOH Implementation Rules on the Regulations on Public Places Sanitation Administration, read in conjunction with the State Council Regulations, prohibit smoking in indoor public places including specifically public transport. In addition, another set of rules, jointly issued by six ministries, prohibits smoking in public transport, but allows smoking rooms or smoking areas in transportation that runs long hours. Smoking in commercial aircraft is only prohibited in passenger cabins and toilets for domestic flights, and in designated non-smoking areas of passenger cabins and toilets in international flights. However, in reality, smoking is prohibited in passenger cabins and toilets in both domestic and international flights. Some local regulations prohibit smoking in all public transport. 
The law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to commercial aircraft because it does not provide for 100% smoke free public transportation and, therefore, does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure.

","The law prohibits smoking in many public places including public conveyances.

Therefore, smoking should be prohibited on commercial aircraft. However, the realization of the ÔÇ£100% Smoke FreeÔÇØ regulatory status of public transportation depends upon local implementing legislation. The Health Law requires that ÔÇ£local governments have to designate smoke free zones in their area of jurisdiction.ÔÇØ Similarly, Art. 52 of Government Regulation (PP) No. 109 of 2012 requires local governments to undertake implementation of smoke free areas. Neither the law nor the PP sets a deadline by which local governments must act, and some local governments have passed legislation while others have not.

The law does not align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, because it does not provide for 100% smoke free indoor workplaces, public places, and public transport, and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should require all parts of all public transport to be 100% smoke free.
","Smoking is prohibited in commercial aircraft. Sections 47(1) and 47(8) of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA) (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 16) prohibit smoking in a ÔÇ£specified place,ÔÇØ which by definition includes ÔÇ£an aircraft.ÔÇØ  Therefore, commercial aircraft are smoke free.

At the national level, the language of the law is not obligatory and does not outright require a ban or restrictions on smoking in public transport, including planes, but rather ÔÇ£to tryÔÇØ to take measures ÔÇ£as necessaryÔÇØ. Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Smoking Not RestrictedÔÇØ is given. This regulatory status is also given because there are no penalties associated with failure to comply with the provisions of the national law.

However, in practice, smoking is prohibited in commercial aircrafts.

The national law does not align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines because it does not provide for 100% smoke free commercial aircraft and therefore does not provide effective or universal protection against tobacco smoke exposure. To align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the national law should require all commercial aircraft to be 100% smoke free.

However, in practice, implementation and enforcement of the law has been inconsistent.  Further, the law authorizes the Minister of Health to allow designated smoking areas in public places, although the Minister has not done so with respect to commercial aircraft.

","Section 33(2) gives an extensive list of public places and workplaces in which smoking is permitted in specially designated areas.

In addition, smoking areas should have no furniture. Because the law allows for smoking areas in airports, the regulatory status code ÔÇ£Smoking is RestrictedÔÇØ is given.

There do not appear to be any sanctions in the rules for violations of the duty to post signs.  However, it may be possible to broadly interpret the penalties established in COTPA for violations of Section 4 to apply here.  See COTPA Section 21:  ÔÇ£Whoever contravenes the provisions of section 4 shall be punishable with fine which may extend to two hundred rupees.ÔÇØ ","There is no duty imposed upon business owners, employers, or supervisors to post signs indicating that smoking is prohibited on the premises, where applicable. 

To align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should impose a duty upon the owner, manager, or other person in charge of the premises to post clear signs at entrances and other appropriate locations indicating that smoking is not permitted. ","Section 46 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 (PHA), (as amended by PHA 2004, Section 15) imposes a duty on business owners to post no-smoking signs.  Failure to post no-smoking signs is an offense subject to a fine of up to 3000 Euros or up to three months in prison, or both. (See Section 5 of PHA 2002, as amended by Section 3 of PHA 2004.)

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines in that it imposes a range of penalties. To more closely align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should also provide for higher fines for repeat offenders.","The law requires owners, lessees, or those otherwise in possession of a public place to post no-smoking signs. Manufacturers or importers of elevators designed to carry people in residential buildings must also post no-smoking signs in these elevators before the elevators go into commission. The Minister of Health has the authority to issue regulations specifying the size, number, and contents of the signs.

Violators are subject to a fine in the amount set forth in Section 61(A)(3) of the Penal Code, 1977. Section 61(A)(3) establishes a fine in the amount of 67,300 New Israel Shekels (NIS), which amounts to roughly $17,200 (USD).  The Minister of Justice, with the consent of the Minister of Health, may impose a higher fine, but not more than ten percent greater than the maximum fine.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines with respect to requiring no-smoking signs and imposing fines on those who fail to post. To more fully align with FCTC Art. 8 and the FCTC Art. 8 Guidelines, the law should provide for a range of penalties, including license suspension or revocation, and should also provide for higher penalties for repeat violations.","The regulations require that the managers, owners, or lessees of smoke free premises is required to post a ÔÇ£No SmokingÔÇØ sign as set out in the Third Schedule at each entrance and in one additional prominent location.

This notification states that if a smoking area is established, non-smoking areas and smoking areas should be clearly labeled.

Second, if the person fails to stop smoking, the manager or operator must ask the individual to leave immediately.  Third, if the individual refuses to leave, the manager or operator may then seek the assistance of the police or other authorized officers.

Providing separate definitions of ÔÇ£advertisingÔÇØ and ÔÇ£promotionÔÇØ is also undesirable, especially when the ban included in the Act of 9.11.1995 refers to both advertising and promotion.

These rules apply to all broadcast media licensed by Ofcom (Office of Communications). All frequencies on TV and radio are licensed by Ofcom and are subject to the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising. Therefore, tobacco advertising is prohibited on all domestic broadcast media, including TV, radio, satellite, and cable, among others.

In addition, the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive (Directive 2010/13/EU) applies in the UK and prohibits audiovisual commercial communications for tobacco products.

The law and decree align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to all internet communications.  
","Article 3(1) of the law prohibits all forms of advertising or promotion of tobacco products by using the name, logo, or trademark of the product or producer. Additionally, Art. 3(5) of the law prohibits all forms of announcements or advertisements of tobacco products in the media using the product name, logo, or trademark, no matter what the purpose may be.  These provisions could be interpreted as prohibiting tobacco advertising via internet communications. 

In practice, tobacco companies collect email addresses from people, and may send them advertisements in this way.

","The law prohibits tobacco advertising via the internet aimed at the United Kingdom or European market.  However, the law allows tobacco advertising via the internet if it is published by a person who does not do business in a European Economic Area (EEA) State and whose principal market is not an EEA State. Thus, tobacco advertising could appear on an internet website accessible in Wales but not aimed at the Welsh or European market. For example, an internet website in Bahasa Indonesia aimed at the Indonesia market could be accessed in Wales and could contain tobacco advertising.
<br> <br>
Although the law restricts but does not prohibit all tobacco advertising on the internet, the law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 52, which states that ""Parties should make use of their sovereign right to take effective actions to limit or prevent any cross-border tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship entering their territory.""  However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should contain provisions to ban tobacco advertising in all internet communications, regardless of the country of origin and principal target market.

Therefore, the law is interpreted as prohibiting internet tobacco product sales within Canada but allowing internet sales based internationally.  At least one province, Quebec, requires face-to-face retail sales, which makes internet tobacco products sales illegal.

Together, these provisions are interpreted to prohibit the sale of tobacco products through the internet.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to internet sales of tobacco products. However, this could be made clearer by explicitly stating that internet sales of tobacco products are prohibited as inherently involving tobacco advertising and promotion, as provided in FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines paras. 18-19.   ","The law does not address tobacco product sales by internet. Therefore, the law is interpreted as allowing such sales.

","According to Act 9.11.1995 all advertising and promotion of tobacco products is banned, including advertising via internet communications. However, this provision does not ban internet tobacco product sales and, under Polish law, there is no legal basis for considering such sales as advertising or promotion. Moreover, access to websites selling tobacco products hosted on foreign servers is practically unrestricted for internet users in Poland. Introduction of technical restrictions on access to such websites is unlikely and in all probability would be considered as contradictory to Polish constitutional rights and freedoms of individuals.

Sales of tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age, sales of tobacco products in packages containing less than 20 units and sales of tobacco products in bulk without packaging are prohibited.  This prohibition covers all channels of distribution, including internet sales.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should make it clear that internet sales of tobacco products are prohibited as inherently involving tobacco advertising and promotion. At the same time, it is important to remember that the actual scope of the ban and the relation between the provisions of Act 9.11.1995 and the FCTC and the FCTC Guidelines may be affected by the differences between the definitions of tobacco advertising and promotion in the above-mentioned laws.
","The law prohibits remote retail sales, which includes internet sales. However, the law contains a small exception that may permit delivery by mail for towns that have no stores. To fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should clearly prohibit all internet tobacco product sales.","The Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act (TAPA) 2002, as amended by the TAP (Amendment) Regulations 2006, Section 4(5) (adding Section 4(1B)), excludes the sale of tobacco products by internet from the definition of an advertisement. Therefore, the internet sale of tobacco products and their display on websites is allowed.  Moreover, Section 8(2) of TAPA 2002 permits the sale of tobacco products in the UK by internet websites based outside the EEA (European Economic Area).  Section 8(2) (as amended by Schedule 4 of the 2009 Health Act) also states that it is not an offense for a service provider established outside the UK to do anything in the course of providing information society services.  Although the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) (TPMS) Act 2010 prohibits the ""display"" of tobacco products, the Act specifically states that a website is not a ""place"" for purposes of prohibiting the ""display"" of tobacco products (TMPS, Section 1(6)).

","The law prohibits virtually all advertising of tobacco products, including through the internet, but does not address internet tobacco product sales specifically.  It is unclear whether the ban on tobacco advertising prohibits tobacco sales via the internet as inherently involving advertising and promotion.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should make it clear that internet sales of tobacco products are prohibited as inherently involving tobacco advertising and promotion, as provided in FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines paras. 18-19.  ","A decree prohibits the sale of tobacco and tobacco products via the internet and requires internet service providers, institutions delivering credit cards, and shipping and delivery services to take measures to prevent internet sites from engaging in tobacco and tobacco product sales.

The decree aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to all internet tobacco product sales.   
","The law prohibits the sale of tobacco products through electronic shopping media, like the internet, except by authorized dealers.

Because the two provisions conflict, the regulatory status ÔÇ£UncertainÔÇØ has been assigned.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines paras. 18-19, the law should make clear that all internet tobacco product sales are prohibited as an inherent form of advertising.","The Law does not specifically prohibit the sale of tobacco products by the internet. However, the law prohibits the sale of tobacco products to minors under the age of 18 and requires the posting of notices stating this prohibition in places that sell tobacco products.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should clearly state that internet sales of tobacco products are prohibited as inherently involving tobacco advertising and promotion, as provided in FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines paras. 18-19.","The law strictly prohibits advertising and promotion of tobacco products, direct marketing to the users of tobacco in any form, and encouraging, persuading, and coercing other people to use tobacco.

PHA 2009 also permits a pictorial list containing visual images of tobacco packages at duty-free shops in airports. Because of these exemptions, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Some RestrictionsÔÇØ is given.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in so far as it prohibits tobacco product displays at the point of sale.  For greater certainty, the definition of ÔÇ£tobacco advertisingÔÇØ should include commercial measures with the effect or likely effect of promoting tobacco products, directly or indirectly.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit the display and visibility of tobacco products at all points of sale as this is form of advertising and there should be a comprehensive ban on all domestic and cross-border tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, to the extent allowed by the Canadian Constitution.","The law does not address point of sale product displays specifically.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all tobacco product display and visibility.  ","The display of tobacco products for sale is restricted by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), a multidisciplinary government agency whose duties include the licensing of tobacco importers, wholesalers, and retailers.

The total area of display at each premise may not exceed 2 square meters. The display of each variant of tobacco product is limited to the largest area of the smallest unit sold. Displays within 2 meters of the outside may not face outside. The display must be such that health warnings on the products must be visible to consumers.
Finally, a tobacco-selling premises that is operated by a single business operator may have only one display of tobacco products. However, a department store or a large-scale multiple-business facility that has a total business area of 3,000 square meters or more with various merchandise retail sub-units may have one more tobacco product display area, or an additional tobacco product display area that is less than 2 square meters, for every 3,000 square meters.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, all tobacco product displays at points of sale should be included in the ban on tobacco advertising and promotion. 
","Product display at point of sale is currently prohibited in large retail shops but allowed in small retail shops, bulk tobacconists, and specialist tobacconists. Regulations were adopted in 2012 that prohibit the display of tobacco products in retail establishments, but continue to allow product display at specialist tobacconists and bulk tobacconists. These regulations entered into force for large shops in December 2012 and are scheduled to come into force for small shops and other shops (excluding specialist tobacconists) in April 2015. Display at bulk tobacconists will be restricted to areas of the store containing only tobacco products.

Decree 602 further elaborates that this ban includes any tobacco advertising and promotion ""in the public thoroughfare, and in spaces of public use, such as showplaces, restaurants, bars, discotheques, gaming rooms, malls or any other type of place or establishment used by the public."" Tobacco advertising and promotion is broadly defined to include any commercial action with the purpose, effect, or likely effect of promoting tobacco use or products. Brand marking of public spaces or things in the public thoroughfare, such as venues, retail outlets, vehicles or other structures, with word, designs, or images associated with tobacco products is a commercial action aimed at promoting tobacco. Therefore, this action is prohibited under the general advertising ban.

The law aligns with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, with respect to brand marking.
","Brand marking is prohibited except for within tobacco retail outlets. The definition of ÔÇ£advertising includesÔÇØ anything that promotes words and/or designs that are closely associated with a tobacco product or range of tobacco products. The prohibition on ÔÇ£publishing a tobacco advertisementÔÇØ includes supplying something that contains a tobacco advertisement to the public.  These provisions together prohibit the use of designs, images, logos, or colors to promote tobacco products on venues, vehicles or the outside of retail outlets.  Because the law allows point of sale advertising at retail outlets, the law is interpreted as allowing brand marking inside retail outlets.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the prohibition on brand marking should extend to retail shops.","The law prohibits disseminating advertising of tobacco products through any means. The definition includes any kind of commercial action with the aim of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use either directly or indirectly. The law, therefore, prohibits brand marking on physical structures.  

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking on physical structures.  For greater certainty, the definition of ÔÇ£tobacco advertisingÔÇØ should include commercial measures with the effect or likely effect of promoting tobacco products, directly or indirectly.
","Brand marking is allowed, although subject to some restrictions that apply to all permitted forms of tobacco advertising and promotion. Advertising, including brand marking, is prohibited on plastic bags. Specifically, it is prohibited for any manufacturer, importer, supplier, distributor, or vendor of cigarettes and other tobacco products to create advertising by representing a young person or a celebrity. Additionally, it is prohibited to promote tobacco products among young people. Aside from these restrictions, advertising through distinctive words, designs, images, logos, sounds or colors is permitted.

","The law prohibits tobacco advertising through any medium.  However, because the term ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ is not defined under the law, it is difficult to determine the scope of the ban and whether brand marking is covered.  Therefore, the regulatory status ÔÇ£UncertainÔÇØ is given.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should clearly prohibit brand marking.  For greater clarity, the law should define the term ÔÇ£tobacco advertising in promotionÔÇØ in accordance with the definition provided in FCTC Art. 1.
","The law prohibits ÔÇ£commercial advertisingÔÇØ of tobacco products, with the sole exception of the display of tobacco products at points of sale.  Under this exception, only tobacco product packaging may be visible and, therefore, brand marking is not permitted.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.  The law could be made clearer by using the term ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ and defining it in accordance with FCTC Art. 1(c).","The law prohibits publishing, displaying, selling, or distributing a ""tobacco product advertisement."" The definition of ""publish"" is broad and includes ""issuing, showing, displaying, exhibiting or making known an advertisement in any manner whatsoever."" The definition of ""tobacco product advertisement,"" when read with the definition of ""advertisement,"" is also broad. The definition includes ""any writing on any vehicle or any other object or thing"" and ""any poster, placard, notice or other document affixed . . . on any other object or thing"" to induce, expressly or indirectly, the use of tobacco or a tobacco product. In addition, the definition of ""tobacco product advertisement"" specifically includes any advertisement ""which mentions, illustrates or depicts"" a name, brand name, trade name, or trademark of a tobacco product or ""pictorial device commonly associated with a brand name of or trade mark relating to any tobacco product."" Therefore, brand marking on physical structures and vehicles, which uses distinctive words, designs, images, logos, sounds or colors to promote tobacco products, is prohibited.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.
","The law does not directly address brand marking on physical structures.  However, the law contains a general prohibition of all advertising and promotion of tobacco products.

Thus, brand marking is prohibited to the extent that it is used in media advertising or in prohibited places (e.g., waiting rooms, cinemas and theaters, meeting halls, sports sites and gyms), but is not necessarily prohibited in other venues, on vehicles, etc.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should impose a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, including brand marking.  To clarify the scope of the ban, the law should define ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ in accordance with the FCTC definition.","The law does not expressly address brand marking. However, there are three provisions that could be interpreted as banning brand marking.  

First, Art. 14 of the law prohibits tobacco promotion by all media, including written media ÔÇ£or similar media.ÔÇØ A decision by the Constitutional Court (C-830-10) found that the phrase ÔÇ£or similar mediaÔÇØ ÔÇ£shows the unequivocal intention of the lawmaker to extend the ban against promoting tobacco products to any instrument directed to transmitting information to the general public.ÔÇØ Therefore, it could be argued that brand marking, which promotes tobacco to the public, is banned under this provision.

Second, Art. 15 of the law prohibits ÔÇ£billboards, placards, murals, posters, public notices or the like that are mobile or fixed related to the promotion of tobacco and its derivatives.ÔÇØ It could be argued that brand marking of vehicles or structures violates this provision.

Third, Art. 16 of the law prohibits ÔÇ£all forms of promotion of tobacco products and its derivatives.ÔÇØ The law does not define ÔÇ£promotion.ÔÇØ However, a Constitutional Court case (C-830-10) found that ÔÇ£promotionÔÇØ should be understood to have the meaning of ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ as set forth in the FCTC.  Using this definition, it could be argued that tobacco advertising by brand marking is prohibited.  

Based on the interpretation of these three provisions, the regulatory status ÔÇ£BannedÔÇØ is assigned. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking. However, to clarify the scope of the ban on tobacco advertising and promotion and aid in enforcement, the law should provide a definition of ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ in accordance with the definition contained in the FCTC.
","The Tobacco Control Law and Regulations prohibit any kind of advertising and promotion of tobacco products or tobacco derivatives. The law provides for two limited and regulated exemptions (inside adult-only venues that do not have smoke free space and through direct communication with vendors and consumers), neither of which applies here. Brand marking on structures and vehicles, etc. falls within the definition of ÔÇ£advertising and promotion of tobaccoÔÇØ and the definition of ÔÇ£promotion of tobaccoÔÇØ contained in the tobacco control law and is therefore prohibited. In addition, the Regulations specifically prohibit the ÔÇ£use of advertising on vehicles intended for the distribution of tobacco products and tobacco derivatives.ÔÇØ

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to tobacco advertising and promotion through brand marking on structures, vehicles, etc.
","The Organic Law prohibits ÔÇ£displaying, promoting or producing any object that is not a tobacco product which contains elements from a tobacco product brand.ÔÇØ Therefore, brand marking venues, outlets, vehicles, or any other object or premises with words, designs or images related to a tobacco product is prohibited. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.
","The law does not address brand marking and ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ is not defined, making it difficult to determine if the ban on advertising and promotion applies to brand marking. 

For the law to align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, brand marking should be prohibited under the broad ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, and the term ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ should be defined in accordance with FCTC Art. 1(c). ","The law prohibits the use on any non-tobacco product or service of any images, logos, or emblems associated with a tobacco product. Thus brand marking is prohibited.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.
","The law prohibits ""any direct or indirect advertising or publicity promoting tobacco [and] tobacco products."" There have been several court decisions that have confirmed that the ban on direct and indirect advertising and publicity covers brand marking.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines. To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship in accordance with constitutional considerations.","The law does not specifically address brand marking as a means of advertising and promotion.  In addition, there is no broad ban on advertising and promotion.  Therefore, brand marking is permitted, although subject to some restrictions.  Article 23 prohibits ÔÇ£written media,ÔÇØ and although this term is not defined, it is interpreted to ban the use of distinctive words and logos to promote tobacco products.  In addition, the law restricts how ÔÇ£elements of business identificationÔÇØ (e.g., brand name, logo, etc.) may be used, prohibiting their association with images of healthy persons, texts, or any other means of transmission that may lead to tobacco use or that alludes to personal or environmental states of well-being.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should apply a comprehensive ban to all tobacco advertising and promotion, including all forms of brand marking.


","The Smoking Ordinance prohibits the display of ÔÇ£any trade mark or brand name of a tobacco product, or any pictorial device or part thereof commonly associated therewithÔÇØ on any object in the course of conducting any business or providing any service.

The broad definition of ÔÇ£advertiseÔÇØ encompasses signs, symbols, and other visual images.  Therefore, advertising and promotion of tobacco products by brand marking is prohibited.  

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to advertising and promotion of tobacco products by brand marking.","The law and regulations specifically allow tobacco advertising and promotion via print media within establishments that restrict access to adults only, which could include entertainment venues and retail outlets.  It is interpreted that print media can be used not just for words but also for printed designs, images, logos, and colors. To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the Guidelines, the law should apply a comprehensive ban to all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship without exemption, as provided in Guidelines para. 11. ","The law prohibits publishing, displaying or broadcasting ÔÇ£an advertisement relating to the use of tobacco products, including the use of tobacco trade marks, logos, brand names or company names used on tobacco products.ÔÇØ  Therefore, read together with the definition of ÔÇ£advertisement,ÔÇØ which includes any ÔÇ£visual image . . . and any other message . . . aimed at the public and designed to promote or publicise a tobacco product or to promote smoking,ÔÇØ the law bans all forms of brand marking.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with regard to brand marking.
","The Tobacco Products Regulations prohibit the manufacture of any products or the conducting or any services using the brand name or trademark of tobacco products. This provision is interpreted to ban brand marking of venues and outlets with tobacco brand names or trademarks, as these are places that offer services.  In addition, brand marking of vehicles and other non-service offering structures is also banned under the general ban on advertising, which prohibits advertising and promotion though ÔÇ£wall painting, logo, signage, writing, visual, . . . mark, . . . or any other media.ÔÇØ

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.","The law prohibits the use of a tobacco trademark (which, by definition, includes any brand name, company name, or any other name, work or mark that resembles a trademark, whether registered or not) on any article other than a tobacco product; and prohibits the use of a tobacco trademark for the purpose of advertising a service to the public.  This provision is interpreted as prohibiting the use of designs, images, logos, sounds, and colors associated with tobacco products on entertain venues, retail outlets, vehicles and equipment.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking. 
","The law prohibits ÔÇ£any kind of advertising, publicity or propaganda in favor of an institution, a service, an activity, a product or an article other than tobacco, that by its graphic appearance, its presentation, the use of a brand, an advertising emblem or any other distinctive sign calls to mind tobacco or a tobacco product.ÔÇØ The term ÔÇ£promotion-advertisingÔÇØ is defined broadly to include any form of communication or recommendation of action. Therefore, the law prohibits the use of distinctive words, designs, images, logos, sounds or colors.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to distinctive words, designs, images, logos, sounds or colors.
","The law prohibits the use on any non-tobacco product or service of any images, logos, or emblems associated with a tobacco product. Thus brand marking is prohibited.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.
","The Act and Regulations prohibit direct and indirect forms of tobacco advertising. The definition of ÔÇ£indirect advertisingÔÇØ includes the ÔÇ£use of certain colours and layouts/designs that are associated with particular tobacco products.ÔÇØ Therefore, brand marking is prohibited.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.","Neither the 2002 Ordinance nor Notification F.13-5/2003 prohibits or restricts brand marking.  The law is, therefore, interpreted as allowing brand marking. 

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, all tobacco advertising and promotion, including brand marking, should be banned.  In addition, using the term ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ and defining it in accordance with FCTC Art. 1(c) would ensure proper application of a comprehensive tobacco advertising and promotion ban.","The law prohibits all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. By definition, this includes any form of communication or ÔÇ£commercial action that directly or indirectly promotes a tobacco product or its use.ÔÇØ  The E.O. further prohibits promotion of tobacco products by any means of communication (Art. 18) or through any activity that prompts tobacco use (Art. 19). Although the law does not specifically address brand marking, the complete prohibition on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship is interpreted as prohibiting brand marking.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in this respect.  ","The law generally permits brand marking. However, the use of logos, graphics, designs, slogans, symbols, sayings, sales messages, colors or other elements associated with tobacco products is prohibited in health and education facilities. The law does not address brand marking on other structures or in other places and therefore it is interpreted as being allowed.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit brand marking on all physical structures, vehicles and equipment.
","All forms of tobacco advertising in mass media and all outdoor advertising are prohibited except tobacco advertisements placed inside the premises of point-of-sale establishments. The law specifies that the use of tobacco trademarks and brand names is a form of advertising. Therefore, brand marking is interpreted to be prohibited in all communications directed to reach a mass of people and in all outdoor advertising except inside the premises of point of sale establishments. 

The name, logo, or indicia of a cigarette brand is prohibited on any merchandise to be sold or distributed but the law specifically provides that the name, logo, or other indicia of a cigarette brand may appear on cigarette lighters, ashtrays, or other smoking related items and if such name, logo, or other indicia of the cigarette brand is larger than fifty (50) square centimeters, the item must carry a health warning.

The law does not align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it defines brand marking narrowly and allows brand marking inside the point of sale and on smoking related items. ","The ban on advertising included in Act 9.11.1995 explicitly covers advertising and promotion of symbols connected with tobacco use. Therefore, this law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 guidelines.

However, as with all advertising and promotion provisions, the actual scope of the ban and the relation between the provisions of Act 9.11.1995 and the FCTC and the FCTC Guidelines may be affected by the differences between the definitions of tobacco advertising and promotion in the above-mentioned laws.","The law prohibits all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. The law incorporates the FCTC definition of ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotion.ÔÇØ Therefore, the use of distinctive words, designs, images, logos, sounds or color to promote tobacco products in entertainment venues, retail outlets, and on vehicles and equipment is prohibited.  

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.
","The law prohibits the use of any non-tobacco product or service of any images, logos or emblems associated with a tobacco product. Thus, brand marking is prohibited.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.","The law broadly bans all direct or indirect advertising and promotion of tobacco, its products and derivatives, and the companies that manufacture, sell or distribute it. The law also specifically prohibits advertising by any means of communication intended to be read, seen or heard when individual transmissions are directed at several people.  

Therefore, these provisions are interpreted as prohibiting tobacco product advertising via brand marking because this would constitute individual transmissions directed at many individuals. 

However, as of the date of this review, required subsidiary legislation (e.g., implementing decrees and administrative orders) has not been issued by the designated regulatory authority to implement these provisions.
  
The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to tobacco product advertising via brand marking.
","The law prohibits all forms of domestic and cross-border tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. The broad definition of ÔÇ£advertisement,ÔÇØ which encompasses any commercial ÔÇ£communication, act or practice,ÔÇØ including ÔÇ£images, colours and any other graphicsÔÇØ that has the ÔÇ£likely effect of promoting a tobacco product,ÔÇØ covers brand marking. Therefore, all forms of brand marking are banned.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with regard to brand marking.","The law prohibits publishing a tobacco advertisement, including any ad that ÔÇ£illustrates or depicts . . . any pictorial devices commonly associated with a brand name of or a trade mark relating to any tobacco product.ÔÇØ  ÔÇ£AdvertisementÔÇØ is defined very broadly and specifically includes forms of brand marking, such as information disseminated ÔÇ£by means of any writing on any vehicle, ashtray, calendar, cigarette-lighter, clock or any other object or thing.ÔÇØ  Therefore, brand marking is prohibited.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to banning brand marking.","The law prohibits advertising or promoting a tobacco product through any direct or indirect means. The definition of ÔÇ£advertisingÔÇØ includes any ÔÇ£commercial communication or action . . .  with the aim, effect or likely effect of . . .  promoting . . . a tobacco brand element.ÔÇØ Therefore, brand marking is a prohibited form of advertising.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking. ","Law 28/2005 prohibits tobacco advertising and promotion, except for limited enumerated advertising and promotional practices, and explicitly prohibits advertising outside of State tobacco and stamp shops. Brand marking falls within the definition of ÔÇ£advertisingÔÇØ and ÔÇ£promotionÔÇØ and is not on the list of allowable forms of advertising and promotion; therefore it is prohibited.  However the law permits promotional activity within tobacco and stamp shops and therefore the law is interpreted as permitting brand marking within the retail outlet, provided that the brand marking is not displayed outward to the street.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion, including point of sale brand marking.","The law defines tobacco advertisement as, among other things, any writing and/or visual image that promotes the purchase or use of a tobacco product and prohibits such advertisement in any place to which the public has access.  The law is interpreted as banning tobacco advertising and promotion via brand marking on physical structures.  Therefore, the law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking on physical structures.    ","The law prohibits tobacco advertising in publications, TV and radio, transmissions, and ÔÇ£other marketing of tobacco products to consumersÔÇØ other than at point of sale. This catch-all provision, ÔÇ£other marketing,ÔÇØ is interpreted as prohibiting brand marking on retail outlets, vehicle, equipment, etc.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.
","The law prohibits ÔÇ£tobacco advertisingÔÇØ through the use of ÔÇ£display, or through any other written, illustrated form, item or digital recording device.ÔÇØ The definition of ÔÇ£tobacco product advertisingÔÇØ is broad and includes any commercial action with the direct or indirect effect of promoting tobacco. These two provisions together are interpreted as prohibiting designs, images, logos or sounds to promote tobacco products on venues, vehicles or equipment.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.
","The Tobacco Products Act prohibits the promotion of a tobacco product ÔÇ£if any of its brand element is displayed on a non-tobacco product or is used with a service, if the non-tobacco product or service is associated with persons below the age of eighteen or can, on reasonable grounds be capable of appealing to persons under the age of eighteen.ÔÇØ Therefore, brand marking is restricted to uses not associated with, or that appeal, persons below the age of 18.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all brand marking, not just branding marking that is associated with or appeals to persons below the age of 18.
","The law prohibits ÔÇ£exposing the name or mark of the tobacco products in . . . any . . . advertiseable thing or to use the name or mark of the tobacco products in . . . any  . . . activity the objective of which is to let the public to understand that the name or mark belongs to the tobacco products.ÔÇØ This is interpreted as prohibiting brand marking.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking.  ","The law prohibits all advertising and promotion of tobacco products by any means. Therefore, given the broad definition of ÔÇ£advertising and promotion,ÔÇØ tobacco advertising and promotion via brand marking is prohibited. 

Further, a decree clarifies the broad ban on tobacco advertising and promotion to specifically include a prohibition of tobacco advertising and promotion via brand marking in places of entertaining, retail points of sale and/or on vehicles and materials.

The law and decree align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to tobacco brand marking in entertainment venues, retail outlets, and on vehicles.   
","The law specifically states that vehicles that belong to tobacco companies may not bear any kind of sign that remind people of the brand. For other vehicles and other types of physical structures, the prohibition on any form of advertising or promotion of tobacco products that uses the name, logo, or trademark of the product or producer applies. However, only the names, logos, and trademarks of tobacco products and companies are listed as prohibited forms of advertising. It is possible that other forms of branding, such as words, designs, images, and colors may escape the current restrictions. As a result, the regulatory status code ÔÇ£Some RestrictionsÔÇØ is assigned. 

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all brand marking, including the use of words, designs, images, sounds and colors on all physical structures, vehicles and equipment. ","The law prohibits the use of a trademark to customize tobacco products on other types of goods that are not tobacco products. It is unclear whether this includes distinctive words, designs, images, sounds or colors that promote tobacco products, but are not trademarked.  Additionally, it is not clear whether the use of the trademark on entertainment venues, retail outlets, vehicles, or other structures would be prohibited under this provision.  

For better clarity and to align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit brand marking and define the term ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ in accordance with the definition provided in FCTC Art. 1.
","Brand marking is not expressly prohibited, but is prohibited to the extent that it falls into another category of prohibited advertising.  For example, brand marking would be prohibited inside a restaurant because ÔÇ£indoor advertisingÔÇØ is prohibited, but brand marking might be permitted inside a bar, which is specifically excluded from the definition of ÔÇ£indoor advertising.ÔÇØ  In addition, brand marking on vehicles and structures that house events for minors would be prohibited under the Law on Advertising, but brand marking at a venue such as a bar from which minors are excluded would be permitted.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all forms of brand marking on all structures and places.","Article 7 of the Law broadly bans all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship by any media. Article 8 of the 2008 Regulations provides a list of advertising and promotional activities that are prohibited, but clearly states that ÔÇ£this enumeration is not exhaustive.ÔÇØ Although brand marking is not on the non-exhaustive list, brand marking falls within the definition of ÔÇ£advertising and promotionÔÇØ in Art. 7 of the 2008 Regulations. Therefore, the law is interpreted as prohibiting brand marking.  

For clarity of interpretation, it would be useful to include brand marking on the list of prohibited activities.

The law allows for one exception to the comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, allowing advertising at points of sale.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the ban should prohibit point-of-sale advertising and promotion.","The law strictly prohibits advertising and promotion of tobacco products, direct marketing to the users of tobacco in any form, and encouraging, persuading, and coercing other people to use tobacco.  Although the law does not define ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotion,ÔÇØ this ban is interpreted as applying to tobacco brand marking in entertainment and other venues, vehicles, and equipment.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to brand marking. The scope of the ban would be made clearer by defining ÔÇ£tobacco advertising and promotionÔÇØ in the law or regulations in accordance with FCTC Art. 1(c).
","The law prohibits the use on any non-tobacco product or service of any images, logos or emblems associated with a tobacco product. Thus brand marking is prohibited.

"Advertising, Promotion & Sponsorship","Regulated Forms of Advertising, Promotion and Sponsorships","Financial or other sponsorship or support by the tobacco industry to events, activities, individuals or groups (e.g., groups involved in sports, the arts, politics, charitable or welfare, or other activities, or youth smoking prevention programs) Analysis","The law, read in its entirety, prohibits all contributions to any event, activity, individual, or government that has the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use, directly or indirectly.  The law prohibits manufacturers or distributors of tobacco products from brand name promotion and sponsorship of any type of activity or public event. The law also prohibits sponsorship of tobacco products through any broadcast or communications medium.  The definition of tobacco sponsorship in the law includes: any form of contribution to any action, activity, individual, or legal entity, public or private, with the goal or for the purpose of promoting the brand name of a tobacco product. Decree 602 clarifies that tobacco sponsorship is prohibited regardless of whether product brand names are used during the promotion, or whether the patronage was made through a third party. Together, therefore, these provisions are interpreted as prohibiting all financial or other contributions by the tobacco industry, including ÔÇ£corporate social responsibilityÔÇØ programs and youth prevention programs. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial contributions to promote tobacco products or tobacco usage.","The national law permits financial support by the tobacco industry; however, some States and Territories have banned tobacco sponsorship itself, regardless of publicity.  These sub-national bans override more lenient national laws.   To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the national law should prohibit financial or other contributions to any activity, individual, organization, or government that has the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting tobacco products or tobacco use directly or indirectly.  Alternatively, all State and Territory laws should do so. ","The law prohibits all donations, awards, scholarships, or other sponsorship for the purpose of advertising tobacco products or tobacco use.  Because advertising is defined broadly for the purposes of this law, all financial contributions that promote tobacco products or tobacco usage, directly or indirectly, are prohibited.  Despite the broad prohibition, the law appears to simultaneously allow ÔÇ£corporate social responsibilityÔÇØ (CSR) donations by the tobacco industry, so long as the donation does not promote tobacco products or tobacco use.  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial contributions that promote tobacco products or tobacco use.  However, for better clarity, the law should clearly prohibit all CSR contributions by the tobacco industry. ","The law prohibits most sponsoring on behalf of a tobacco product involving events, activities, teams, or individuals.  ÔÇ£SponsoringÔÇØ is defined as ÔÇ£any public or private contribution made to a third party in relation to an event, a team or an activity whose purpose is to promote cigarettes and other tobacco products.ÔÇØ  However, the law allows sponsoring events, activities, teams, or individuals only where all the participants or members are adults.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit any contribution to promote a tobacco product or tobacco use, regardless of whether adults or minors are involved. ","The law prohibits the sponsorship of any educational, cultural, social, or sporting organization or event, such as athletic games, funfairs, fashion and model shows, school functions and international events to promote consumption of tobacco and tobacco products.  The law does not restrict contributions to individuals or to governments.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all contributions that promote tobacco products or tobacco use.","The law prohibits sponsoring of cultural or sporting activities.  Sponsoring is not defined so the scope of that provision is unclear.  Regardless, other forms of financial contributions that promote tobacco use or tobacco products are not prohibited, such as ÔÇ£corporate social responsibilityÔÇØ programs or youth smoking prevention programs.  The law does not align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial contributions. To align, the law should prohibit all contributions that have the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting tobacco products or tobacco use directly or indirectly. ","The law prohibits any contract, agreement, undertaking or understanding, whether legally binding or otherwise, that promotes a tobacco product in exchange for any sponsorship, gift, prize, reward, scholarship or like benefit.  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial or other contributions that promote tobacco products; however, the law does not include contributions that promote tobacco usage not associated with a particular tobacco product. To fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines the law should also prohibit contributions that promote tobacco usage. ","The law prohibits ÔÇ£sponsorship or underwriting in any form toward any activity of any kind whatsoever by the tobacco industry and its appendages.ÔÇØ Sponsorship is defined as any kind of contribution to any event, activity, or person having as its purpose, effect, or likely effect the direct or indirect promotion of a tobacco product or the use of tobacco.  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial contributions to promote tobacco products and tobacco usage. ","The law regulates the publicity of contributions, not the contributions themselves. Therefore, only publicized contributions are prohibited, while non-publicized contributions are permitted even if they promote a tobacco product or tobacco use.  For example, tobacco donations to ÔÇ£corporate social responsibilityÔÇØ programs or youth smoking prevention programs would be permitted (as long as there is no associated publicity).  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all contributions that have the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use, directly or indirectly.  ","The law prohibits any operation for underwriting or sponsorship if its purpose or effect is the promotion or publicity of a tobacco product, whether direct or indirect.  Sponsorship is defined as ÔÇ£any kind of contribution to any event, activity or natural person or corporate entity, having as its aim, effect, or likely effect to promote directly or indirectly, the use of tobacco or of a tobacco product.ÔÇØ  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial contributions to promote tobacco products and tobacco usage. For better clarity, the law should ensure that tobacco sponsorship is prohibited even if it has only the likely effect of promoting a tobacco product. ","The law implicitly allows contributions by the tobacco industry. The law requires tobacco companies to report annually to the Ministry of Health an itemized breakdown of donations made, as well as expenses incurred as a result of agreements with public institutions, athletic or community organizations, academic or cultural institutions, and non-governmental organizations.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all contributions that have the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use directly or indirectly. ","Financial or other contributions that promote tobacco products or tobacco use are allowed.  Therefore, sponsorship is allowed for events, activities, individuals, organizations, or programs.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all contributions that have the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use directly or indirectly. ","The law prohibits sponsorship of sporting and cultural events by tobacco companies or tobacco brands where the sponsorship involves direct or indirect promotion of the consumption of tobacco products and its derivatives.  The law does not prohibit sponsorship of individuals, organizations, governments, or events that are not related to sporting or culture.  Because sponsorship is not defined, the scope of the ban is unclear.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all contributions that have the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting tobacco products or tobacco use directly or indirectly.","The law prohibits any kind of sponsorship of tobacco products and tobacco derivatives.  Sponsorship is defined as any kind of contribution to any act, activity, or individual with the purpose, effect, or possible effect of promoting, directly or indirectly a tobacco product or the use of tobacco.  Additionally, a decree prohibits any kind of sponsorship of tobacco or tobacco derivatives in activities relating to social responsibility.  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial contributions to promote tobacco products and tobacco usage. For better clarity, the law should ensure that tobacco sponsorship is prohibited even if it has only the likely effect of promoting a tobacco product. ","The law prohibits any sponsorship of tobacco products in all mass media or through interpersonal contact. The ban includes sponsorship of tobacco products at sporting, cultural and artistic activities, along with the promotion of ÔÇ£corporate social responsibilityÔÇØ programs by the tobacco industry. Sponsorship is defined as ÔÇ£any type of contribution to any action, activity or individual with the goal, effect or possible effect of directly or indirectly promoting a tobacco product or the use of tobacco.ÔÇØ  The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial contributions to promote tobacco products or tobacco usage.","The law does not have any provisions that explicitly regulate financial or other contributions that promote tobacco products or tobacco use, so such contributions appear to be allowed.  To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all contributions that have the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting tobacco products or tobacco use directly or indirectly.  ","The law prohibits sponsorship agreements made in the course of a business, whose purpose or effect is to promote a tobacco product in the United Kingdom. The law, however, permits a financial contribution by the tobacco industry that does not have as its purpose or effect the promotion of tobacco products. Thus, financial or other sponsorship or support (without publicity) is allowed.  This provision permits tobacco companies to contribute to ÔÇ£socially responsible causesÔÇØ or participate in public education campaigns such as ÔÇ£youth smoking prevention campaignsÔÇØ if the contribution is not publicized.

To fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all financial or other sponsorship or support by the tobacco industry to events, activities, individuals/groups, organizations or governments, regardless of whether that contribution is publicized.","The law prohibits ÔÇ£all sponsorship activities . . . if they have as their purpose or effect direct or indirect publicity or advertising of tobacco, tobacco productsÔÇØ and other tobacco-related ingredients. Although the term ÔÇ£sponsorship activityÔÇØ is not defined, the law is interpreted as prohibiting any financial or other contribution because such a contribution would have the direct or indirect effect of promoting a tobacco product or use. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to financial support to events and activities.","The law does not address financial or other contributions that promote tobacco products or tobacco use.

To align, the law should prohibit all contributions that have the aim, effect, or likely effect of promoting tobacco products or tobacco use directly or indirectly.

Tobacco sponsorship (patrocinio del tabaco) is defined as ÔÇ£any form of contribution to any action, activity, or individual with the goal, effect, or possible effect of directly or indirectly promoting a tobacco product or the use of tobacco-derived products.ÔÇØ Note that the law only prohibits sponsored advertising (los patrocinios publicitarios) rather than the full scope of tobacco sponsorship.

Further, FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 40 provides that Parties should consider requiring that health warning messages be given at least equal prominence to the advertising, promotion or sponsorship. ","The law does not require health warnings on permitted forms of tobacco advertising. Because some limited tobacco advertising and promotion is still permitted (and the regulatory status of other forms is uncertain), the law should require health warnings in these instances in order to fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines.","Currently, the Law on Advertising, Art. 22.7, requires all permitted advertising to be accompanied by a health warning occupying at least 15% of the advertising area. The warning shall state: ÔÇ£Smoking may cause cancer.ÔÇØ It is not clear whether the warning requirement applies to those forms of tobacco sponsorship interpreted to be legally permissible. These requirements remain in effect even after the comprehensive ban on advertising, promotion and sponsorship takes effect in September 2012.

Currently, to align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the warning requirement should clearly apply to all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship not banned or not yet banned and to those very limited commercial communications, recommendations or actions that might continue after a comprehensive ban. Further, FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 40 provides that Parties should consider requiring that health warning messages be given at least equal prominence to the advertising, promotion or sponsorship. ","The Law requires health warnings on permitted advertising (advertising is only permitted at point of sale).  The regulations specify that the health warning must be of ÔÇ£equal dimensions, area, visibilityÔÇØ as the advertisement itself and be contiguous to the advertisement.  Ordinance No. 374 establishes the text and images of the two warnings to appear on permitted advertising.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines with respect to health warnings on permitted advertising.","The law does not require health warning messages on permitted forms of sponsorship. 

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the health warning requirement should clearly apply to all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship not banned or not yet banned.
","Under the 2004 regulations, health warnings are required on permitted forms of advertising at point of sale and on vending machines. (However, the sale of tobacco products by vending machines is now prohibited.) The health warnings must cover 30% of the surface of the permitted advertisement. Currently, advertising at point of sale is prohibited in large retail shops but is permitted elsewhere.  When the TAPA Display Regulations 2012 enter into force for small retailers and other shops (with the exception of specialist tobacconists) in April 2015, point of sale advertising will no longer be permitted at the places.  Point of sale advertising will continue to be permitted only at specialist tobacconists, which would continue to carry health warnings on advertisements.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, which recommend the adoption of health messages where tobacco advertising is still permitted by the law.

Decree 602 holds manufacturers, importers, and those in the advertising industry responsible for violations of advertising and promotion provisions.
<br>
<br>
Violations of advertising and promotion provisions are subject to a ÔÇ£fine in pesos equivalent to the sales value to the end user of ten thousand (10,000) to one hundred thousand (100,000) packages of twenty cigarettes of the highest price sold in the country.ÔÇØ Repeat offenses are subject to a fine of ÔÇ£a value equivalent to one million (1,000,000) packages of the aforementioned.ÔÇØ The law also provides for closure of the any establishment that violates provisions of the law.
<br>
<br>
FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines paras. 60 and 61 provide that ÔÇ£Parties should introduce and apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties (including fines, corrective advertising remedies and license suspension or cancellation)ÔÇØ and that fines should be graded and commensurate with the seriousness of the offense.  
<br>
<br>
To fully align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law should review the penalty provisions to see if tying penalties to the price of cigarettes results in appropriate fines for manufacturers, advertisers, and other parties for advertising and promotion violations.
","Sections 13 and 15 of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act provide that the maximum fine for an individual who publishes or broadcasts an advertisement is 120 penalty units ($13,200 as of January 2007). For a corporation, the fine is up to 600 penalty units ($66,000 as of January 2007).  With respect to tobacco advertising on the internet, the maximum fine for an individual who publishes an advertisement is 120 penalty units. 

Penalties for violating plain packaging provisions, which come into effect in October through December 2012 (times vary for manufacturers and sellers), are: 2000 penalty units for a fault-based offense or civil penalty provision, and 60 penalty units for a strict liability offense.

[Note: The value of a penalty unit is provided by s.4AA of the Crimes Act 1914. As of January 2007, a penalty unit is $110. The Crimes Act 1914 s.4B(3) raises the penalty for a corporation.]

The provisions align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that penalties apply to entities as well as individuals and to officers and agents of corporations for most offenses. However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, penalties should be graded and commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, and should be higher for repeat violations. License suspension and cancellation should also be considered as penalties.","Any person who violates the prohibition on tobacco advertising, promotion or sponsorship may be punished with simple imprisonment up to three months, or a fine up to one hundred thousand taka, or both.  Repeat offenses are subject to doubling of the penalty.   

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for higher penalties for repeat offenses. 
","Any person who contravenes one of the provisions within the law is liable to a fine of five hundred thousand (500,000) to five million (5,000,000) francs CFA.
<br><br>
The law does not align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it does not provide for increased penalties for repeat offenses or for other penalties such as confiscation and corrective action. To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should provide for increased penalties for repeat offenses and other penalties such as confiscation and corrective action. 
","Any person who violates the ban on tobacco advertising contained in Section 18 of the law is subject to a fine ranging from Nu. 1,000 to Nu. 36,000 (Bhutanese ngultrum) per incident.

Any person who produces videos, movies, or cultural shows in Bhutan that contain scenes depicting tobacco use (except in educational clips produced for the purpose of health promotion) commits a petty misdemeanor, which carries a term of imprisonment ranging from a minimum of one month to a maximum of one year.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for a range of penalties.  To more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should consider other penalties such as license suspension or revocation and higher penalties for repeat offenses.
","Fines range from R$5,000  -  R$100,000,000, can be applied cumulatively for repeated offenses, and are applied on the basis of the financial capacity of the offender.

Other penalties include: (1) seizure of the product; (2) suspension of the advertising in the medium of dissemination and of any other advertising of the product for a up to 30 days; and (3) suspension of the programming by the radio or TV broadcaster for 10 minutes for each minute or fraction thereof of the duration of advertisements broadcast in violation of the law, observing the same schedule.

The penalty provisions align with Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that they provide for a range of penalties, for graded penalties, for cumulative application for repeat offenses, and for corrective action.","Any person that violates the ban on advertising set forth in Art. 17 or the promotion provisions of Art. 7 of the Tobacco Order 2005 is subject to a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $20,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both. Any person violating the provisions banning vending machines (Art. 5) or the sale of toys or candy imitating tobacco products (Art. 6) is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000. Corporate bodies as well as individuals may be found guilty of an offense.

The Minister of Health may appoint any person as an ""authorized officer."" Police and authorized officers have the power to arrest, and enter and inspect business premises. They may order the removal of advertisements and seize advertisements.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for a range of penalties, higher penalties for repeat offenses, and holds corporate bodies as well as individuals liable for offenses.","(1) Article 35 of the law provides a penalty for anyone distributing tobacco or tobacco products for free, or gifts or advertising gadgets displaying a tobacco brand in the amount of 100,000 FCFA to 1 million FCFA and authorizes the confiscation or destruction of the products.

(4) Article 38 of the law requires a penalty of 100,000 FCFA to 500,000 FCFA against anyone who uses the image of tobacco products for the purposes of promotion, and grants the local jurisdiction the authority to prohibit broadcast of the offending images. In case of repeat offenses, the broadcaster of the image must be temporarily or permanently closed. 

The penalty provisions align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that they provide for a range of penalties and, in some cases, increased penalties for repeat violations. 
","Promoting a product in a manner not authorized by the Tobacco Act is subject to the following:
1) on summary conviction: a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment up to 1 year, or both;

Any person who violates the prohibition on misleading advertising is subject to a fine not exceeding $300,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years, or both.

Each day an offense is committed is considered a separate offense.  In addition, if an offender has gained monetary benefit from the offense, an additional fine equal to the amount of the monetary benefit may be imposed.

Other penalties may include: prohibiting the offender from engaging in any activity that is likely to result in the continuation or repetition of the offense; directing the offender to publish the facts related to the commission of the offense; and directing the offender to compensate the Department of Health for the cost of any remedial or preventative action taken. ","Anyone who infringes the prohibition of tobacco advertising is liable to imprisonment for twenty (20) days to six (6) months and/or a fine of 50,000 to 5,000,000 Francs CFA. Each day a violation occurs counts as a separate infraction.  Further, in certain instances, if the offender derives a financial advantage from the commission of the offense, the court can impose higher fines over and above those prescribed in the law.  
<br> <br>
In the event that a violation of this law is committed by a corporate entity, the representative thereof, or any other person who has authorized or acquiesced to the offense, shall be considered a co-author of the violation, and will be susceptible to the punishment provided for the infraction in question, regardless of whether or not the corporate entity has taken disciplinary action.
","Violations of provisions related to advertising or promotion of tobacco products (Arts. 3 and 5 of Law 19419) are subject to a fine of 1 to 50 monthly tax units, and of 101 to 500 monthly tax units if the infraction is committed by a natural or juridical person belonging to the tobacco industry.

Violations of the provision regarding vending machines are subject to a fine of 10 to 100 monthly tax units. Repeat offenses are subject to the closing of the establishment, store, or place where the infraction was committed for a period of fifteen days.
<br><br>
The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it imposes a range of fines and sanctions. To more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law should consider imposing administrative sanctions, such as license suspension or revocation, for violations of advertising and promotion provisions.
","For acts of advertising tobacco through broadcast, films, television, newspapers, or periodicals in violation of Art. 18 of the Advertising Law, fines may be imposed ranging from twice to less than five times the advertising expenses.  Corrective action includes stopping the advertising and confiscating the advertising expenses.

For violation of paid depiction of tobacco products, fines may be imposed ranging from twice to less than five times the advertising expenses.  Corrective action includes stopping the advertising and confiscating the advertising expenses.

If permitted advertising does not have the requisite approval, contains prohibited images (e.g., smoking, underage people) or prohibited messages (e.g., health benefits), or does not contain the requisite health warning, a fine up to RMB10,000 may be imposed. Corrective action includes stopping publication of advertising.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should also impose cumulative fines, higher fines for repeat violations, and a range of sanctions including license suspension or revocation.","Retailers and wholesalers that violate advertising and promotion provisions are subject to a fine of from two (2) to three (3) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries. For repeat offenses, the fine is from four (4) to (5) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries.

Other violators of advertising and promotion provisions are subject to a fine of from two hundred fifty (250) to three hundred (300) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries. For repeat offenders, the fine is from three hundred fifty (350) to four hundred (400) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries.

In accordance with FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 60, sanctions ÔÇ£should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties (including fines, corrective advertising remedies and license suspension or cancellation).ÔÇØ The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that the penalties are proportionate and dissuasive, and higher for manufacturers and importers than for retailers and wholesalers.  However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law should consider imposing other sanctions, such as corrective advertising remedies and license suspension and revocation.
","Anyone who fails to comply with any of the provisions relating to tobacco advertising, promotion or sponsorship in the Tobacco Control Law is subject to a fine of 10 times the minimum wage. Minimum wage ÔÇ£refers to the concept used in Article 2 of Law No. 7337, May 5, 1993ÔÇØ, and is published yearly in the Gazette.     
<br><br>
In addition, municipalities and the Ministry of Health may shut down premises that fail to comply with any provisions of the tobacco control law. Further, when entities that have been fined wish to renew permits or licenses, they must present a certificate issued by the Ministry of Health that they are fully up to date with respect to payment of the fines. Also, the Tobacco Control Regulations specify that tobacco advertising may be seized.
<br><br>
The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that the law contains a range of penalties and fines commensurate with the severity of the offense. However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law might consider higher penalties for repeat offenders and requiring corrective or counter-advertising for violations.
","Media entities that violate advertising and promotion provisions are subject to a fine of ÔÇ£from ten (10) to one hundred (100) unified basic remunerations of the general private worker.ÔÇØ A first repeat offense is subject to a fine of from twenty (20) to two hundred (200) unified basic remunerations of the general private worker.

Other individuals or legal entities, such as manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers, that violate advertising and promotion provisions are subject to a fine of from one hundred (100) to two hundred (200) unified basic remunerations of the general private worker. A first repeat offense is subject to a fine of from two hundred (200) to four hundred (400) unified basic remunerations of the general private worker and temporary closure of from one (1) to eight (8) days. Subsequent reoccurrences are subject to a similar fine and temporary closure of fifteen (15) days.

","Article 3 of Law 2002 (amending Art. 7 of Law 1981) imposes fines ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 pounds, and/or a prison term up to 1 year.  In the case of repeat offenses, the penalty is both a fine and prison term.

Other penalties include seizure of materials and tools used in advertising and promotion.  

To align with Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the penalty provisions should also provide for license suspension and/or revocation for those involved in advertising and promotion activities.","Violators of advertising and promotion provisions of the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 are subject to the following: 1) upon summary conviction, imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both; 2) upon conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine, or both. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for a range of penalties depending on seriousness of the violations (civil and criminal penalties). The law does not specifically provide for corrective action; however, this may be available under other general law statutes.
","Infractions regarding the ban on tobacco advertising are punishable by a fine of 100,000 Euros. Fines may increase by as much as 50% of the amount of expenditures for the illegal operation. In case of a repeat offense, a court may prohibit the sale of the products involved in the illegal operation for one to five years.
<br><br>
In determining penalties, the court may decide that the companies wholly or partially share responsibility for payment of the fines and court costs assigned to their managers or agents. 
<br><br>
The court is also to order, as appropriate, the suppression, removal, or confiscation of the forbidden advertising at the expense of the offenders. Either the public prosecutor or an examining magistrate or court hearing the case can order that the advertising be stopped.  The measure is enforceable notwithstanding any avenues of appeal. The order may be reversed by the venue that instituted it or that is hearing the case.  If there is a finding of no grounds for prosecution or the charges are dismissed, the order will cease to have effect. Decisions ruling on motions for reversal may be subject to review before the Court of Appeals or by the court hearing the case. The Court of Appeals or appellate Court shall rule within a period of ten days counting from the filing of the motion.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for a range of penalties based on the seriousness of the violation and provides for confiscation and corrective action. To more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law could provide for license suspension or revocation for violators.
","Violations of advertising restrictions are punishable by a warning. If the violator does not correct the infringement after a warning, any one of more of the following penalties may be imposed: fines ranging from two to 150 monthly wages for non-agricultural activities; temporary or permanent closure of an establishment; suspension of activities; confiscation of advertising related to the violation; or publication in two major newspapers at the expense of violator regarding the violation and penalty. For repeat offenses, the fine may be doubled from that of the first violation.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it imposes a range of penalties and increased penalties for repeat violations. ","(1) Article 41 provides sanctions for failure to withdraw prohibited advertising, setting the amount of the fine at 100 minimum monthly salaries and the seizure and destruction of the prohibited advertising.  (The duty to withdraw unlawful advertising and promotion is articulated in Art. 25.)

(2) Article 46 provides sanctions for producing or marketing prohibited items ÔÇô snack candies and toys that look like tobacco products.  Manufacturers, importers, vendors, and distributors who violate this provision face a fine of 10 monthly minimum salaries; seizure and destruction of the prohibited products; and closure of the operation for 30 days.

The sanctions are: a fine in the amount of 10 minimum monthly salaries, for the first offense; and a fine in the amount of 20 minimum monthly salaries plus closure of the company for 30 days, for recurring violations.

(4) Article 52 provides sanctions for engaging in forbidden advertising.  The appropriate fiscal authorities are to collect a fine of 100 minimum monthly salaries and destroy the forbidden advertisements.   

The law provides a range of penalties, including corrective action, and higher penalties for repeated violations in accordance with the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines.  However, the law should also include graded penalties as called for in FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 61.
","For violations of advertising provisions, Section 15 of the Smoking Ordinance provides for ÔÇ£a fine at level 5 and, in the case of a continuing offense, to a further penalty of $1500 for each day during which the offense continues.ÔÇØ  (A Level 5 fine is HK $50,000 under Cap. 221.)

Section 14 of the Smoking Ordinance provides for corrective action, which includes seizure and disposal of the advertisement.

To align with Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should also provide for cumulative or greater penalties for repeat offenses, and license suspension or revocation where appropriate.","Violations of Art. 7 of the Tobacco Control Act (advertising and promotion provision) are subject to a fine, or in the case of gross or repeated violations, imprisonment for up to two years. The amount of the fine is unspecified in the Tobacco Control Act. However, Art. 17 states that in the case of violations ÔÇ£the board may apply the same measures as are stated in art. 27 of the Health and Pollution Control Act no. 7/1998ÔÇØ. 

In accordance with FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 60, sanctions ÔÇ£should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties (including fines, corrective advertising remedies and license suspension or cancellation).

However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law should consider imposing additional sanctions, such as corrective advertising remedies and license suspension or cancellation.","(1)  Penalties include: (a) in case of a first conviction, imprisonment for a term up to two years or a fine up to 1,000 rupees or both; (b) in case of a second or subsequent conviction, imprisonment up to five years or a fine up to 5,000 rupees or both; (c) possible forfeiture of tobacco products; and (d) confiscation and disposal of advertising material.  The CTNA also imposes a range of penalties including seizure of equipment, fines, and imprisonment, but it is unclear how COTPA and CTNA legislation which may permit indirect advertising are read together. 
(2)  The law does not provide for corrective action such as removal of the tobacco advertising, promotion, or sponsorship, or publication of court decisions.  Funding of corrective or counter-advertising, all at the cost of the violator(s), should be authorized.
(3)  The law should impose a range of penalties sufficiently large to deter violations, graded and commensurate with  the nature and seriousness of the violation and the legal duty of the violator, that outweigh the potential economic benefits to be derived.  Penalties should be applied primarily against managers, directors, officers, and/or legal representatives of corporate entities when they are responsible for corporate violatorsÔÇÖ conduct.  The law also should provide for corrective action.","The PP provides that any person who promotes and /or advertises tobacco products must comply with the lawÔÇÖs advertising and promotion provisions within 12 months of promulgation of the PP. The PP authorizes the Food and Drug Control Agency, in coordination with other ÔÇ£relevant agencies,ÔÇØ to impose administrative sanctions on violators, including oral and written warnings and temporary suspension of activities, and to require product recalls. The Broadcast Law provides penalties of two years in prison and/or a fine up to 500 million rupiah for violations of advertising restrictions on radio; and penalties of two years in prison and/or a fine up to 5 billion rupiah for advertising violations on television. The Press Law provides for a fine up to 500 million rupiah for violations of advertising restrictions in the press. To align with best practice, as reflected in the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion.  The penalty provisions also should provide for cumulative application for repeat offenses. ","The Public Health (Tobacco) Act (PHA) 2002, Section 10(1)(j), imposed a duty to enforce upon the Office of Tobacco Control (OTC); however the OTC was dissolved and replaced by the Health Service Executive by PHA 2010.

","The law does not prohibit tobacco advertising, promotion or sponsorship (APS). Rather, restrictions on APS exist in Japan only by industry self-regulation pursuant to the Tobacco Business Act, which calls on advertisers to make ""efforts that their advertising not be excessive"", and non-binding guidelines issued pursuant thereto. Because the guidelines are non-binding, there is no agency responsible for enforcement and no penalties for non-compliance. However, the Tobacco Business Act, Art. 40(4), provides that where provisions of the guidelines are disregarded the Minister of Finance may publicize the matter.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, paras. 53 ÔÇô 68, the law should prohibit tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and define widely responsible entities, covering the entire marketing chain.

Penalties for other advertising and promotion violations (such as the ban on advertising on TV and radio, the ban on advertising in certain locations, and the ban on sponsorship) are not specified in the national law or regulations.

For example, the Jesus Maria district of Lima, has established sanctions for certain advertising and promotion violations in the amount of 3600 PEN (or less than 1 UIT). The Magdalena del Mar district of Lima has established penalties of 10 UIT for violations of all advertising and promotion provisions. For some violations, the local penalties fill a void, for other violations, the local penalties seem to conflict with the national fines.  The Ministry of Health is currently drafting guidelines for the establishment of local sanctions.

In accordance with FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 60, sanctions ÔÇ£should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties (including fines, corrective advertising remedies and license suspension or cancellation).

Additionally, the law provides that persons who violate the law are guilty, but the consequences of such violation are uncertain.  For better clarity, the law should provide a clear enforcement system including duties and penalties for all involved.  
","Article 26.1 of the Law on Advertising designates the authorized agencies. Law on Advertising, Art. 27.2, sets forth the entities that can be held responsible. Fines are provided in Art. 27.4 in the amount of: 1) for advertisers ÔÇôfive times the cost of distributing the advertising; 2) for producers of advertising ÔÇô five time the cost of producing the advertising; 3) for distributors of advertising ÔÇô five times the cost of distributing the advertising. For repeat violations, fines are doubled. If the cost of the advertising cannot be determined, fines are set imposed up to ÔÇ£300 minimum personal tax-free incomes.ÔÇØ ÔÇ£Minimum personal tax-free incomeÔÇØ is currently 17 UAH. Therefore the fine is 300 x 17UAH = 5100 UAH.  Pursuant to the Code on Administrative Offenses, violations of provisions on tobacco advertising contained in the Law on Advertising are subject to ÔÇ£a fine on citizens of from five to ten times the untaxed minimum income of citizens and on officials of the advertiser and/or the distributor of the advertising ÔÇô from one hundred to two hundred and fifty times the untaxed minimum income of citizens.ÔÇØ 

Under the Law on Tobacco Control, violations of provisions on tobacco advertising and promotion are subject to a fine ÔÇ£from thirty thousand hrivnyas to fifty thousand hrivnyas for each instance of advertising on an individual advertising medium.ÔÇØ 

To more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the penalty provisions should provide for a range of penalties, including license suspension and corrective action.","Penalties for violation of any provisions of the law include warnings, fines ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 UI (Indexed Units), and temporary closure, depending upon the severity of the offense.

Where it is established that a violation of Art. 7 (advertising, promotion and sponsorship) or Art. 11 (vending machines and free distribution) of the law has occurred, the Ministry of Public Health may close the establishment for up to five consecutive days. In the event of a recurring violation, the Ministry may close the establishment for up to 30 days. 

Aggravating circumstances include the accumulation of two or more breaches.","The Ministry of Information and Communication is responsible for preventing placement of advertising, promotion and sponsorship by tobacco companies on mass media and publications and controlling tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship by tobacco companies.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for issuing fines for violations of the tobacco control law in the areas and sectors under the MinistryÔÇÖs management.

The Ministry of Public Security is responsible for handling violations of the tobacco control law in the areas under the ministryÔÇÖs management and coordinating with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to enforce fines for violations of tobacco control regulations.

Other ministries and ministerial-level agencies are responsible for and must coordinate with relevant ministries to organize the handling of administrative violations of the tobacco control law in the field of their assigned responsibility.

The Cultural Sector Administrative Violations Decree provides for: - fines ranging from 500,000 VND to 5,000,000 VND for advertising tobacco products on painting, picture, billboard, flyer, fold-out, parasol, cart, flag streamer, and other similar forms of advertising; and - fines ranging from 10,000,000 VND to 20,000,000 VND for advertising on cargo boxes affixed to motorcycles, means of transportation, other moving objects, or kept stationary at public places. Sanctions also include seizure of evidence, such as the advertising object. The law does not specifically state what entities may be held responsible, i.e., whether advertising companies as well as manufacturers/importers/retailers of tobacco products may be held responsible. 

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should specify who may be held responsible, provide for a range of penalties, including higher fines for repeat offenses, cumulative fines, and license suspension and revocation. 
","Violators of advertising and promotion provisions of TAPA are subject to the following: 1) upon summary conviction, imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both; 2) upon conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine, or both. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for a range of penalties depending on seriousness of the violations (civil and criminal penalties). The law does not specifically provide for corrective action; however this may be available under other general law statutes.

Decree 602 holds manufacturers, importers, and those in the advertising industry responsible for violations of sponsorship provisions.
<br>
<br>
Violations of sponsorship provisions are subject to a ÔÇ£fine in pesos equivalent to the sales value to the end user of ten thousand (10,000) to one hundred thousand (100,000) packages of twenty cigarettes of the highest price sold in the country.ÔÇØ Repeat offenses are subject to a fine of ÔÇ£a value equivalent to one million (1,000,000) packages of the aforementioned.ÔÇØ The law also provides for closure of the any establishment that violates provisions of the law.

<br>
<br>
To align with best practice, as reflected in FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law should review the penalty provisions to see if tying penalties to the price of cigarettes results in appropriate fines for manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, and retailers for sponsorship violations. 
","Sections 13 and 15 of Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act provide that the maximum fine for an individual who publishes or broadcasts an advertisement is 120 penalty units ($13,200 as of January 2007). For a corporation, the fine is up to 600 penalty units ($66,000 as of January 2007).  

[Note: The value of a penalty unit is provided by s.4AA of the Crimes Act 1914. As of January 2007, a penalty unit is $110. The Crimes Act 1914 s.4B(3) raises the penalty for a corporation.]

The provisions align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that penalties apply to entities as well as individuals and to officers and agents of corporations. However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, penalties should be graded and commensurate with seriousness of the offense, and should be higher for repeat violations. License suspension and cancellation should also be considered as penalties.","Any person who violates the prohibition on tobacco advertising, promotion or sponsorship may be punished with simple imprisonment up to three months, or a fine up to one hundred thousand taka, or both.  Repeat offenses are subject to doubling of the penalty.   

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for higher penalties for repeat offenses. 
","Any person who contravenes one of the provisions within the law is liable to a fine of five hundred thousand (500,000) to five million (5,000,000) francs CFA.

","Fines range from R$5,000  -  R$100,000,000, can be applied cumulatively for repeated offenses, and are applied on the basis of the financial capacity of the offender.

Other penalties include: (1) seizure of the product; (2) suspension of the advertising in the medium of dissemination and of any other advertising of the product for a up to 30 days; and (3) suspension of the programming by the radio or TV broadcaster for 10 minutes for each minute or fraction thereof of the duration of advertisements broadcast in violation of the law, observing the same schedule.

The penalty provisions align with Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that they provide for a range of penalties, for graded penalties, for cumulative application for repeat offenses, and for corrective action.","Any person that violates the ban on sponsorship set forth in Art. 8 of the Tobacco Order 2005 is subject to a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $20,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both. Corporate bodies as well as individuals may be found guilty of an offense. The Director-General of Health Services or an authorized person may compound this offense by collecting a sum not exceeding $500.

The Minister of Health may appoint any person as an ""authorized officer."" Police and authorized officers have the power to arrest, and enter and inspect business premises. They may order the removal of sponsorship materials and seize sponsorship materials. 

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that it provides for a range of penalties, higher penalties for repeat offenses, and holds corporate bodies as well as individuals liable for offenses. ","Article 36 of the law requires a fine of 1 million FCFA to 50 million FCFA for anyone guilty of sponsoring or causing to be sponsored any activity of any kind whatsoever by the tobacco industry or its appendages and authorizes the confiscation and destruction of the advertising items.. 

The penalty provisions align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that they provide for a range of penalties. To fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should consider other penalties such as license suspension or revocation for violations of the sponsorship ban, and cumulative application for repeat offenses.
","A person engaging in tobacco sponsorship would be in violation of the general prohibition on promotion in Sec. 19 of the Act.  Promoting a product in a manner not authorized by the Tobacco Act is subject to the following:
1) on summary conviction: a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment up to 1 year, or both;
2) on conviction on indictment: a fine not exceeding $300,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years, or both.

As with other offenses, each day an offense is committed is considered a separate offense.  In addition, if an offender has gained monetary benefit from the offense, an additional fine equal to the amount of the monetary benefit may be imposed.

Other penalties may include: prohibiting the offender from engaging in any activity that is likely to result in the continuation or repetition of the offense; directing the offender to publish the facts related to the commission of the offense; and directing the offender to compensate the Department of Health for the cost of any remedial or preventative action taken. ","Anyone who infringes the prohibition of tobacco sponsorship is liable to imprisonment for twenty (20) days to six (6) months and/or a fine of 50,000 to 5,000,000 Francs CFA. Each day a violation occurs counts as a separate infraction. Further, in certain instances, if the offender derives a financial advantage from the commission of the offense, the court can impose higher fines over and above those prescribed by law. 
<br> <br>
In the event that a violation of this law is committed by a corporate entity, the representative thereof, or any other person who has authorized or acquiesced to the offense, shall be considered a co-author of the violation, and will be susceptible to the punishment provided for the infraction in question, regardless of whether or not the corporate entity has taken disciplinary action.
","The law does not prohibit tobacco sponsorship and therefore there are no fines or penalties associated with tobacco sponsorship.

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should prohibit all tobacco sponsorship (whether publicized or not) and impose appropriate penalties for violations of a ban on tobacco sponsorship.
","For violations of publicity of sponsorship (Arts. 8 and 9 of the Interim Tobacco Advertising Management Rules), fines may be imposed ranging from twice to less than five times the advertising expenses.  Corrective action includes stopping the advertising and confiscating the advertising expenses. 

To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the law should impose a complete ban on sponsorship and publicity thereof. However, for any permitted sponsorship or publicity thereof, the law should also impose cumulative fines, higher fines for repeat violations, and a range of sanctions including license suspension or revocation.","Retailers and wholesalers that violate sponsorship provisions are subject to a fine of from two (2) to three (3) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries. For repeat offenses, the fine is from four (4) to (5) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries.

Other violators of sponsorship provisions are subject to a fine of from two hundred fifty (250) to three hundred (300) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries. For repeat offenders, the fine is from three hundred fifty (350) to four hundred (400) prevailing monthly legal minimum salaries.

In accordance with FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines para. 60, sanctions ÔÇ£should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties (including fines, corrective advertising remedies and license suspension or cancellation).ÔÇØ The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that the penalties are proportionate and dissuasive, and higher for manufacturers and importers than for retailers and wholesalers.  However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law should consider imposing other sanctions, such as corrective advertising remedies and license suspension and revocation.
","Anyone who fails to comply with any of the provisions relating to tobacco advertising, promotion or sponsorship in the Tobacco Control Law is subject to a fine of 10 times the minimum wage. Minimum wage ÔÇ£refers to the concept used in Article 2 of Law No. 7337, May 5, 1993ÔÇØ, and is published yearly in the Gazette.   
<br><br>
In addition, municipalities and the Ministry of Health may shut down premises that fail to comply with any provisions of the tobacco control law. Further, when entities that have been fined wish to renew permits or licenses, they must present a certificate issued by the Ministry of Health that they are fully up to date with respect to payment of the fines. 
<br><br>
The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that the law contains a range of penalties and fines commensurate with the severity of the offense. However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the drafters of the law might consider higher penalties for repeat offenders and requiring corrective or counter-advertising for violations.
","Media entities that violate advertising and promotion provisions are subject to a fine of ÔÇ£from ten (10) to one hundred (100) unified basic remunerations of the general private worker.ÔÇØ A first repeat offense is subject to a fine of from twenty (20) to two hundred (200) unified basic remunerations of the general private worker.

Subsequent reoccurrences are subject to a similar fine and temporary closure of fifteen (15) days.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines in that the law provides for a range of penalties and increased fines for repeat offenses.
","The law does not use the term ÔÇ£sponsorshipÔÇØ nor specifically prohibit sponsorship.  The law therefore does not set penalties for a violation of a prohibition on sponsorship.  To the extent that tobacco sponsorship is prohibited under the ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, the following penalties apply.

Article 3 of Law 2002 (amending Art. 7 of Law 1981) imposes fines ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 pounds, and/or a prison term up to 1 year.  In the case of repeat offenses, the penalty is both a fine and prison term.

Other penalties include seizure of materials and tools used in advertising and promotion.  

To align with Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, the penalty provisions should also provide for license suspension and/or revocation for those involved in advertising and promotion activities.","Violators of sponsorship provisions of the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 are subject to the following: 1) upon summary conviction, imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both; 2) upon conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine, or both.

","Infractions regarding the ban on tobacco sponsorship are punishable by a fine of 100,000 Euros. Fines may increase by as much as 50% of the amount of expenditures for the illegal operation. In case of a repeat offense, a court may prohibit the sale of the products involved in the illegal operation for one to five years.
<br><br>
In determining penalties, the court may decide that the companies wholly or partially share responsibility for payment of the fines and court costs assigned to their managers or agents. 
<br><br>
The court is also to order, as appropriate, the suppression, removal, or confiscation of the forbidden advertising at the expense of the offenders. Either the public prosecutor or an examining magistrate or court hearing the case can order that the advertising be stopped. The measure is enforceable notwithstanding any avenues of appeal. The order may be reversed by the venue that instituted it or that is hearing the case. If there is a finding of no grounds for prosecution or the charges are dismissed, the order will cease to have effect. Decisions ruling on motions for reversal may be subject to review before the Court of Appeals or by the court hearing the case.

","Sponsorship is not prohibited by law. Therefore, there are no penalties. To align with FCTC Art. 13 and the FCTC Art. 13 Guidelines, all tobacco sponsorship should be prohibited and appropriate penalties imposed for violations.","Article 41 provides sanctions for failure to withdraw prohibited sponsorships, setting the amount of the fine at 100 minimum monthly salaries and the seizure and destruction of the prohibited advertising.

(2)  The law does not provide for corrective action such as removal of the tobacco advertising, promotion, or sponsorship, or publication of court decisions.  Funding of corrective or counter-advertising, all at the cost of the violator(s), should be authorized.
(3)  The law should impose a range of penalties sufficiently large to deter violations, graded and commensurate with the nature and seriousness of the violation and the legal duty of the violator, that outweigh the potential economic benefits to be derived.  Penalties should be applied primarily against managers, directors, officers, and/or legal representatives of corporate entities when they are responsible for corporate violatorsÔÇÖ conduct.  The law also should provide for corrective action.","Any person who produces and /or imports tobacco products may engage in tobacco sponsorship, but many forms of sponsorship are banned.

	Beginning January 1, 2016, tobacco product packages must display a text warning on the lower part of the front surface, occupying 30%. When this part of the law comes into effect, the law will meet FCTC Art. 11, with warning labels displayed on both the front and back and occupying at least 30% of each PDA. However, FCTC Art. 11 recommends that the warnings occupy at least 50% of each PDA.</p>

	One of seven authorized picture/text warnings must occupy 75% of the two principal display areas of the tobacco product package, placed towards the top of the package. An English version of the warning must appear on one surface and a Malay version on the other surface. If the package is cylindrical or conical, the warning must appear on the largest surface. If the package is spherical, the warning must appear on the external surface. Each of the seven warnings should appear on an equal number of containers of each kind of tobacco product over the course of a 2-year period. The law does not specify how frequently the warnings are to be updated. However, the 2007 warnings were replaced by new warnings in 2012. The same requirements apply to small containers (9,000 square millimeters or less); however, there are only three warnings in rotation during a two-year period.</p>

	The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to warning size, location, and rotation.┬á In order to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, any pending implementing instruments should require that warnings be composed of both text and pictures and identify the number of messages to be in use at any given time.</p>
","<p>
	Packages of smoked tobacco products must depict up to three types of labeling: health warnings, health information, and toxic emissions. Packages of all smoked tobacco products must contain health warnings. Packages of most smoked tobacco products must also contain health information and toxic emissions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>1) Health Warnings:</strong> For cigarettes and little cigars, one of 16 health warnings must occupy at least 75% of each of the two principal display areas (front and back), with English on one side and French on the other.┬á The principal display areas of various types of packages (e.g., slide and shell package, two-sided package, cylindrical packages) are set forth in Schedule 1 of the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars).┬á The contents of the health warnings for cigarettes are set forth in Part 1 of Division A of the 2011 source document, and the contents for little cigars are set forth in Part 1 of Division B of the 2011 source document.</p>
<p>
	For cigarette tobacco, kreteks, and leaf tobacco, health warnings must cover 50 percent of the principal display areas and must be displayed in English on one side and in French on the other side. The health warnings are set out in Part 1 of the source document.</p>
<p>
	For bidis, one of four text health warnings (no pictures) must be displayed, occupying 50% of the principal display areas. (See Tobacco Products Information Regulations, Sec. 5(4).)</p>
<p>
	For pipe tobacco (except pipe tobacco in pouches), one of four warnings from Part 2 of the source document must be displayed occupying at least the top 50% of the principal display areas (front and back), with English on one side and French on the other.<br />
	<br />
	For pipe tobacco in pouches, cigar boxes, and cigar bundles, one of four bilingual warnings from Part 3 of the source document must be used.</p>
<p>
	For pipe tobacco in pouches and cigar boxes, a bilingual warning label must appear on one side, and must be at least 20 cm<sup>2</sup> if the display surface is less than or equal to 149 cm<sup>2</sup>, and at least 40 cm<sup>2</sup> if the display surface is greater than 149 cm<sup>2</sup>.<br />
	<br />
	For cigar bundles, a bilingual warning label must be at least 40 cm<sup>2</sup> and be placed anywhere on the bundle, other than the top and bottom surfaces.<br />
	<br />
	Health warnings must be displayed concurrently on each brand over the course of a year.</p>
<p>
	<strong>2) Health Information:</strong> Packages of cigarettes and little cigars must contain one of 16 ÔÇ£health informationÔÇØ messages on an insert of approximately 50mm X 88mm or, in the case of slide and shell packages without a lateral side, the health information message must appear either on the upper slide-flap and the exterior surface of the slide portion of the package or on a leaflet inserted into the package.┬á Leaflet inserts are not required in cylindrical packages, soft packages, two-sided packages, three-sided packages, or cartons (other than cartons containing soft packages, for which leaflets are required).┬á</p>
<p>
	Cigarette tobacco (except cigarette tobacco in pouches), kreteks, leaf tobacco, and tobacco sticks must contain one of 16 ÔÇ£health informationÔÇØ messages either anywhere on the package other than the principal display surface or the bottom, or on an insert of approximately 50mm X 88mm or, in the case of slide and shell packages, on the slide portion of the package.</p>
<p>
	<strong>3) Toxic Emissions: </strong>Smoked tobacco products are no longer required to bear quantitative emission yields.┬á Instead, all packages must include a qualitative statement about toxic constituents.┬á Schedule 2 of the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars) identifies the display area of packages of cigarettes and little cigars on which the toxic emissions statement must be printed.┬á</p>
<p>
	These provisions substantially align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines. However, there may be instances with cigars and pipe tobacco where the health warnings do not occupy 30% of the display area because a specified size is mandated rather than a percentage, and moreover are required to appear on only one principal display surface. In addition, the regulations should mandate pictorial warnings for bidis, as they do for other tobacco products.</p>
","<p>
	Interministerial Administrative Order No. 23/MCIA/MSP/MF/2000 requires a text warning on the lateral sides of all ÔÇ£packsÔÇØ of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The warning text must be at least 1.5 millimeters in height. It is unclear whether this text warning is required on outer packaging and labeling (e.g., cartons).┬á</p>
<p>
	As of the date of this review, Interministerial Administrative Order No. 23/MCIA/MSP/MF/2000 remains in effect, but it is our understanding that it will be superseded by a new administrative order to be issued by the Minister of Public Health to give effect to the packaging and labeling requirements contained in Art. 13 of the Tobacco Control Law. Once in effect, the law will require health warnings on packs, cartons, and all outer packaging of tobacco products manufactured, imported, and sold. These warnings must cover at least 50% of the front and back surfaces. The law states that the warnings <em>may</em> be in the form of drawings or pictures, but does not seem to require that the warnings include drawings or pictures.┬á Further details about rotation are expected in the new administrative order.</p>
<p>
	The current law does not align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines because it does not require rotating graphic health warnings occupying at least 50% of each of the two principal display areas.</p>
<p>
	Once the law is fully in effect, the law will align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines in that it will require warnings that occupy 50% of display areas.┬á To better align with the Guidelines, the rules should require, at a minimum, multiple graphic warnings showing different tobacco-caused harms that occupy at least 50% of all principal display areas and that change after a specified period of time.</p>
","<p>
	The Ministry of Health has issued five sets of warnings. Each set contains two pictorial warnings, one to be placed on 50% of the front of the package and one to be placed on 50% of the back of the package.┬á The warnings should be placed on the lower part of each surface.</p>
<p>
	Each of the five sets of warnings must appear on an equal number of tobacco packages (i.e., each warning set must appear on 20% of tobacco packages). The current five sets of warnings remain in effect for 24 months from the effective date.</p>
<p>
	One side surface must contain a descriptive constituents and emissions message.</p>
<p>
	The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to the size, content, placement, and rotation of health warnings.</p>
","<p>
	Text-only health warnings are required to occupy no less than 30% of the front and back of packs and cartons. Regulations require Chinese-language warning messages on the fronts and English-language warning messages on the backs of the pack. Under the regulations, the height of the Chinese characters and the font of the English language warnings should be no less than 2.0 mm. The background color of the warning message can be the same as the existing color or pattern of the packaging. Only two nearly identical rotating messages are authorized.</p>
<p>
	Tobacco companies are allowed to design their own labels as long as they meet the minimum requirements set by the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA). For example, in 2011, the China National Tobacco Corporation (CNTC) published a&nbsp;Notice on Further Strengthening the Degree of Cigarette Package Warning Labeling, which&nbsp;requires its subordinate companies to abolish the English warning, enlarge the font of the warning characters from 2.2mm to 4mm, and require the color shading between the warning characters and the warning area background to be obviously different. CNTC&#39;s notice is a self-regulation issuance and not a legal enactment.</p>
<p>
	The requirements for health warnings/messages may technically meet the minimum FCTC Art. 11 requirements with respect to the space taken up by the warnings and to rotation. However, to meet minimum FCTC Art. 11 obligations requiring large, clear, visible, and legible warnings, the rules should require the text to be displayed in a font larger than 2.0 mm and the background color to have a different appearance from the existing color or pattern of the rest of the packaging, as provided in the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines. To better align with the Guidelines, the rules should require, at a minimum, multiple pictorial warnings showing the different tobacco-caused harms that occupy at least 50% of all principal display areas and that change after a specified period of time.</p>
","<p>
	A warning text and accompanying image must appear on the two principal display areas (front and back) of the tobacco product package, and occupy 30% of each display area.┬á The warning must appear in a black box (2mm border) on a white background, in black Helvetica 14-point font.</p>
<p>
	There are 6 authorized text/image warnings.┬á Each of the 6 warnings must appear on an equal number of packages of each brand each year.┬á The Ministry of Welfare shall update the warnings annually, by November 20. By July 21 of the following year, manufacturers and importers may not offer for sale any packs displaying earlier health warnings.</p>
<p>
	The law meets the minimum size requirements of FCTC Art. 11 (30%) and exceeds the minimum requirements by containing pictorial warnings.┬á However, to more fully comply with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require pictorial health warnings that occupy at least 50% of each principal display area.</p>
","<p>
	Pictorial health warnings must occupy 50% of the two principal display areas (front and back) of tobacco product packages, placed on the lower portion of the pack. The Ministry of Health has issued six (6) sets of authorized warnings. Each set contains two combined picture and text warnings, for a total of 12 warnings, with different warnings for the front and back of the pack. These warnings must be rotated in such a way that they are distributed evenly across tobacco product packaging. The Ministry of Health must update the authorized warnings annually.</p>
<p>
	The law requires that a qualitative warning on constituents and emissions appear on 100% of one of the lateral sides of the tobacco product packaging. The Ministry of Health issued six (6) such warnings together with the six (6) sets of pictorial health warnings for the front and back surfaces of packages. However, of these six warnings, only one is actually a qualitative constituent and emission warning; the other five are additional health warnings.</p>
<p>
	The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines regarding size, placement, content, and rotation of health warnings on smoked tobacco product packaging. However, to more fully align, the Ministry of Health should revise the lateral side warnings so that all six such warnings contain qualitative statements on constituents and emissions.</p>
","<p>
	Combined text and pictorial health warnings must cover the bottom 60% of both principal display areas. The six warnings must be printed in a rotating manner so that they are distributed equally across┬ábrands and brand families.</p>
<p>
	The law also requires that qualitative health information on toxic constituents and emissions occupy 70% of one side panel of tobacco product packages.</p>
<p>
	For packages that do not have two principal panels and side panels, or whose panels have different formats or display types, the health warnings must be displayed on┬á60% of its principal and most visible panel(s), directly on the surface of any material.</p>
<p>
	If there are no side panels for the health information, the health information statement must┬ábe printed next to the health warning in a sufficiently visible and distinctive manner. ┬á</p>
<p>
	The health warnings┬áalign with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines because they contain text and pictures, are 60% in size, and contain rotation standards.</p>
","<p>
	The 2007 Law requires one warning to be printed on all tobacco product packages: ÔÇ£Warning: Smoking damages health and causes death.ÔÇØ Decree 443 and the Bylaw of Law No. 52 of 1981 require that under this principal warning must be printed an additional warning: ÔÇ£The damaging effects of smoking strike both the smoker and the non-smoker.ÔÇØ</p>
<p>
	The Bylaw requires these two textual warnings to be accompanied by a picture ÔÇô e.g., of a heart, lung, or pregnancy - with additional relevant text. The picture and text should be rotated every six months.</p>
<p>
	These warnings must occupy 50% of the front and back panels of the tobacco package.</p>
<p>
	These provisions meet FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size and frequency of rotation.</p>
","<p>
	The law mandates the display of one of two text warnings occupying 30% of the front of the package, and one of 14 picture warnings with accompanying text occupying 40% of the back of the package. Tobacco products only designed for the retail travel sector (duty-free products) can carry picture warning number 14, or an alternative picture warning specifically provided for duty-free products. The warning area must be enclosed by a border, which is not included in the 30% and 40% calculation. The border brings the total size of the warning area to 43% of the front surface and 53% of the back surface.</p>
<p>
	The front and back warnings must be rotated so that each warning appears a roughly equal number of times over a 12-month period (between 47.5% and 52.5% for front surface warnings, and between 4.16% and 8.33% for back surface warnings). Warnings on cartons must be rotated equally over a three-year period.</p>
<p>
	While the law aligns with the minimum size requirements of FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size (at least 30%), to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require that warnings cover at least 50% of both principal display areas, and include picture warnings on both display areas. In addition, the law should mandate that the responsible authority update the content of the warnings every 12&ndash;36 months.</p>
","<p>
	All packaged units of smoked tobacco products must bear a general text-only warning and a specific written warning accompanied by an image. The general warning must cover at least 30% of the external area of the main surface of the packaging unit. The specific warning must cover at least 40% of the reverse of the main surface of the packaging unit. These minimum surface areas do not include the black border surrounding the warning, which must measure 3mm and cannot overlap with the warning message. All health warnings must be on the lower part of the surface on which they are printed.</p>
<p>
	The general warning must read ÔÇ£Smoking killsÔÇØ or ÔÇ£Smoking is seriously harmful to your health and to that of the people around you.ÔÇØ</p>
<p>
	The specific warning must contain a written warning selected from a list of 14 warnings prescribed by the Minister of Health and a photograph or other illustration, also prescribed.</p>

	Every warning must be in bold black Helvetica characters on a white background and in lower case, except for the first letter of the message, and centered in the surface on which the text is to be printed, parallel to the upper edge of the pack.</p>
<p>
	The law requires even distribution of each and every warning with a variance of no greater than 5%.</p>
<p>
	Specific warnings must be at least in quadrichrome (CMYK) at 133 lines per inch, and must be conceived as images to be taken together without being modified, except by reason of the size of the packaging unit.</p>

	The law requires text warnings to occupy 30% of each of the two principal display areas, located on the lower part of the package.&nbsp; The warning on the front of the package must be in Hebrew, and the warning on the back of the package must be in Arabic.&nbsp; Twelve different warnings are prescribed, and must rotate so that all appear &ldquo;regularly and with equal frequency.&rdquo;&nbsp; Equal frequency is deemed to be each warning appearing on 6.33% to 10.33% of the packaging for any given brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On the outer packaging for bulk retail products (e.g., cartons), only one text warning is prescribed &ndash; &ldquo;Smoking Kills.&rdquo;&nbsp; This warning must be printed in both Hebrew and Arabic, and must occupy 30% of each of the two principal display areas.</p>
<p>
	The law meets the FCTC Art. 11 minimum requirements for size and rotation. To better align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, Parties should consider graphic health warnings that cover 50% of more of the principal display areas.&nbsp; In addition, the law should mandate that the warnings be updated every 12-36 months.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>
	The regulations require health warnings covering at least 60% of each principal display area (front and back).&nbsp; Warnings are composed of both pictures and text and are to be placed at the top of the principal display areas.&nbsp; Warnings are framed by a border with a maximum thickness of 0.5 mm.&nbsp; In addition, a qualitative statement about constituents and emissions, called a &ldquo;declaration,&rdquo; must occupy 100% of one side panel.&nbsp; The declaration is to be printed in black text on a yellow or white background.</p>
<p>
	For conical packages, the health warnings designated as &ldquo;front&rdquo; and &ldquo;back&rdquo; must both appear on the main surface area, located opposite one another, and covering 60% of the main surface area.&nbsp; Packages of other shapes must also display the prescribed warnings on 60% of the upper surface area on both the front and back panels.</p>
<p>
	Regarding rotation, warnings are divided into two sets of eight warnings (16 total).&nbsp; The eight warnings in any given set must appear equally across packs.&nbsp; Each set is to appear exclusively for eight months, followed by a four-month transition period to the other set.&nbsp; Following that transition period, the next set is to appear exclusively for eight months, etc.&nbsp; Rotation dates are synchronized with World No Tobacco Day &ndash; e.g., Set A is to be displayed beginning June 1; Set B will begin transitioning on February 1 of the following year, with Set A phased out by May 31.</p>
<p>
	The warnings for smoked tobacco products are set out in Part III of the First Schedule.</p>
<p>
	On cartons, health warnings are to appear on all six sides of each carton, occupying 60% of each side.&nbsp; Like on unit packaging, there are two sets of eight warnings (16 total).&nbsp; An individual carton must depict at least three different health warnings.&nbsp; The declaration containing qualitative information about constituents and emissions may be located on any side except for the top or bottom, and must occupy an area of at least 2cm x 6cm.&nbsp; Rotation of the warnings on cartons follows the same schedule rotation of the warnings on unit packaging.&nbsp; The warnings for cartons of smoked tobacco products are set out in Part VI of the First Schedule.</p>
<p>
	Vendors of individual sticks and electronic nicotine delivery systems (&ldquo;ENDS&rdquo;, or e-cigarettes) must display health warnings on signs.</p>
<p>
	The warning requirements do not apply to tobacco products purchased, ordered, or acquired, or the arrival of which was pending or under construction by relevant authorities before June 27, 2014.</p>
<p>
	The regulations meet the requirements of FCTC Art. 11 and align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines.</p>
","<p>
	ÔÇ£CompaniesÔÇØ and ÔÇ£specified distributorsÔÇØ are required to choose and display one or more phrases from two different groups of four designated health warnings (eight approved warnings in total). Where a company or specified distributor chooses to display two or more phrases from the two different groups of four designated health warnings, they must not use the same statement twice or more.</p>
<p>
	Health warnings must also be displayed equally over a calendar year among different types of tobacco products (cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, shredded tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff tobacco) and different types of packaging (packs, cartons and inserts).</p>
<p>
	For packaging where it is difficult to distinguish the main surfaces or where it would be difficult to display the designated warnings, the Ministry of Finance is authorized to decide on the requirements for displaying health warnings. Also, the Ministry of Finance can authorize different phrases and the manner in which they are displayed on packages of cigars, pipe tobacco, shredded tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, and manufactured tobacco substitutes.</p>
<p>
	To align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the Minister should issue regulations requiring that health warnings cover at least 50% or more of each principal display area, with pictures and accompanying text.</p>
","<p>
	Public Health Law No. 47, Article 52 requires health warnings approved by Jordanian Standards and Metrology or the Ministry of Health to be displayed on all tobacco products produced, imported into, or sold in the country. JS 466/2012 (the implementing regulations) requires that the one authorized text-onlly health warning occupy 40% of the front of cigarette packs, placed length-wise down the long edge of the pack. One of four authorized picture-plus-text warnings must occupy 40% of the back of the pack, placed along the bottom edge. The warnings must be surrounded by a black border and printed on white background. The 40% calculation does not include the border. The law requires &quot;regular&quot; distribution of the four picture-plus-text warnings. The law does not specify the duration of this round of warnings.</p>
<p>
	The law meets FCTC Art. 11 in that the health warnings are larger than the minimum 30% required by the FCTC and there is a picture warning on one side of the pack. However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law and/or implementing regulations should require that the warnings occupy at least 50% of the principal display areas and that the picture warnings appear on all principal display areas. In addition, the law should require rotation of the warnings, by having multiple health warnings appearing concurrently or by setting a date after which the health warning content will change, or both, as specified in FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines para.19.</p>
","<p>
	Warnings are required to bear the word ÔÇ£WARNING,ÔÇØ be in 17-point type, and black on white background or white on black background. Warnings must be in English and Kiswahili. If the required type size would occupy more than 70% of the principal display area (PDA), then type size may be smaller but conspicuous, provided that at least 60% of the PDA is occupied by the required text.</p>
<p>
	The required text size of 30% front and 50% back of the PDA is in accordance with FCTC Art. 11 requirements.</p>
<p>
	The Minister may prescribe picture or pictogram warnings by notice in the Gazette, however the Minister has not yet done so. To align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the Minister should prescribe picture warnings in addition to text.</p>
<p>
	Even distribution and rotation of the 12 text messages is required in a 12-month period. The law does not specify the frequency or time period in which the Minister should update the messages. The health messages were last updated in 2007. The Minister should consider updating or issuing a new set of warnings to replace the current set of warnings every 12 to 36 months, as recommended by FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines para. 22.</p>
","<p>
	The law currently requires text warnings on the front and back sides of tobacco packs.&nbsp; The front side of the pack must have one of two text warnings covering 32% of the surface area. The back side must have one of 11 additional text warnings covering 45% of the surface area.&nbsp; The warnings are required to rotate, but no instructions are given as to the timing of the rotations.</p>
<p>
	Thirty-six months following the implementation of the 2013 tobacco control law (May 2016), new graphic warnings will be required on all tobacco packs.&nbsp; The actual content of the pictures is still uncertain. &nbsp;The size, location, and rotation requirements will remain the same.</p>
<p>
	The current law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size, location, and rotation of the health warnings. &nbsp;To more fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require health warnings to cover at least 50% of both the front and the back of all tobacco product packaging.</p>
","<p>
	The current law (Law No. 394/95) requires one text warning (ÔÇ£The ministry of health warns you that tobacco use leads to dangerous and deadly diseasesÔÇØ) on both the front and back surfaces of tobacco product packages. The law does not specify the size of the text warning. In practice, text warnings have generally covered 15% of the surface area.</p>
<p>
	Once in effect, Law No. 174 will require that text health warnings be placed on tobacco product packages covering 40% of the two widest sides.┬áThe law authorizes the Minister of Public Health to determine the content of the warnings, and grants the Minister of Public Health and Minister of Finance the authority to require pictorial warnings.┬áDecree No. 8991 was issued in October 2012 and establishes the content of the health warnings, in addition to setting placement and rotation requirements.┬áThe packaging and labeling provisions of Law No. 174 and the provisions of the decree were scheduled to enter into force on October 4, 2013.  However, implementation has been delayed.</p>
<p>
	The law does not currently align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines. When the new health warning requirements enter into force, the law will meet with the minimum requirements of FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size (at least 30%).┬áHowever, to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require that warnings cover at least 50% of both principal display areas, and include picture warnings on both display areas. In addition, the law should mandate that the Ministry of Public Health update the content of the warnings every 12-36 months.</p>
","<p>
	As of January 1, 2013, smoked tobacco product packages must carry one of six authorized pictorial health warnings, occupying 50% of the two principal display areas. The health warnings are made up of an illustration, a health warning, and a quitline number. The combined warnings must appear on one principal display area in Chinese and on the other principal display area in Portuguese. The law requires rotation and specifies that each combined health warning ÔÇ£must be printed on the respective package for a maximum continuous period of 12 months.ÔÇØ It is unclear from this language whether this means that the six warnings run consecutively, each being displayed for a 12-month period, or if the warnings run concurrently and a new set of six warnings will be issued after a 12-month period. The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines regarding form, content, and size.</p>
","<p>
	The law requires a photo or color image to cover at least 50% of the front surface of the packaging unit, as well as a text-only warning covering at least 50% of the lower rear surface of the packaging unit. Currently, there are four warnings authorized to be displayed at a time, to be used simultaneously for a period of no longer than one year.</p>
<p>
	On cartons, the law requires the text portion of the health warnings to cover at least 50% of the main surface of the carton.</p>
<p>
	The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size and rotation of warnings on unit packaging and labeling. However, the law could more closely align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines if it required pictorial warnings to be displayed on both principal display areas rather than just one principal display area, as suggested in para. 14 of the Guidelines. In addition, the law would be clearer if it contained a definition of ÔÇ£outside packaging and labelingÔÇØ in accordance with the definition provided in FCTC Art. 11, and required pictorial health warnings on each main surface of all outside packaging and labeling.</p>
","<p>
	The regulations require that one of six authorized health warnings, with a graphic picture and accompanying text, appear on each packet and carton of cigarettes. For unit packages of cigarettes, the text and graphic warning must occupy 50% of the front of the package and 60% of the back of the package. The text of the warning is in Malay on the front panel and English on the back panel.</p>
<p>
	For cartons, the warning must occupy 50% of the top panel and 60% of the bottom panel. The text of the warning is in Malay on the top panel and English on the bottom panel. In addition, a qualitative (descriptive) constituent and emissions message must appear on one side panel of cigarette packages and on the front or back panel for cartons. The regulations do not require health warnings on smoked tobacco products other than cigarettes.</p>
<p>
	The regulations require that each of the six authorized health warnings appear as far as possible on an equal number of packaging of each brand and type of cigarette. The current authorized set of health warnings came into effect in January 2014.</p>
<p>
	To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the regulations should require health warnings on all tobacco products, not just cigarettes. The regulations meet FCTC Art. 11 with respect to minimum size of the health warnings, in that both the front and back panel warnings occupy more than 30% of the surface area. However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, authorized health warnings should be updated every 12 to 36 months, in accordance with FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines para. 22.</p>

	A decree requires that the warning be printed in bold, black Helvetica characters, indelible and plainly legible, on a white background and in lower case, except for the first letter of the message, on the lower part of the pack, carton or any other form of packaging of tobacco products, parallel to the lower edge, all of it being included in a rectangle whose borders are black, with a thickness of at least 3 mm.</p>
<p>
	The law and decree meet the minimum requirements of FCTC Art. 11 in that the warnings occupy at least 30% of the two principal display areas of the package. However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require warnings be composed of pictures and text, include a variety of messages to be displayed at any given time, and require that the warnings rotate on a regular basis. In addition, the law should expressly require the warnings to appear at the top of the pack and on at least 50% of each main surface area.</p>
","<p>
	On cigarette packages, the required text and picture must occupy 60% of the front (in French), 70% of the back (in English), and 65% of the sides (in English on one side and French on the other side).</p>
<p>
	One of the required eight messages with picture must appear on each package in English and French. It is unclear from the regulations how the eight health warnings are rotated or how frequently they are updated.</p>
<p>
	On cigars and pipe tobacco, one health warning is required to be displayed in both English and French. Ten-point font is required, but no percentage of the box is specified. The position on the package is not specified.</p>
<p>
	To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the Public Health Regulations should require that the warning on cigars and pipe tobacco occupy 50% or more, but no less than 30%, of the principal display areas. In addition, for all tobacco products, the Public Health Regulations should specify rotation requirements, with updating of messages every 12 &ndash; 36 months.</p>

	Pictorial health warnings were implemented in April 2014, following an unsuccessful challenge by the tobacco industry initiated in 2011. The law requires warning messages and pictures occupying 75% of the total outside surface of the packaging. The Directive issued under the law specifies the warnings to be placed on the front, back, top, and two sides on all packages of cigarettes and bidis. There is one picture and corresponding text warnings that are to appear on all packages of cigarettes, and one picture and corresponding text warnings that are to appear on all packages of bidis.</p>
<p>
	For cigarettes, a picture of a blackened lung and the warning message ÔÇ£smoking and consuming tobacco causes lung cancerÔÇØ must occupy 75% of front and back of the package, aligned from the top (the text occupies the top 25% and the picture occupies the middle 50% of the package). The warning message ÔÇ£tobacco product is injurious to health, smoking killsÔÇØ must be printed across the top of the pack. The warning message ÔÇ£smoking contains carcinogenic substances such as Nitrosamine and Benzopyrene, stop smokingÔÇØ must be printed on the right side panel, and the warning message ÔÇ£the nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide contained in smoking causes heart and lung disease, stop smokingÔÇØ must be printed on the left side panel.</p>

A warning message in English and te reo Maori, corresponding explanatory message, corresponding graphic, and Quitline logo must cover 90% of the back of the package. An information message must occupy one entire side of the package.</p>
<p>
	For cigarettes, the warnings must be rotated, with seven of the 14 authorized messages appearing in even-numbered years, and the remaining seven appearing in odd-numbered years. Each warning with corresponding graphic and explanatory message must appear as nearly as possible on equal numbers of packages of each different brand. The change in the set of 7 messages begins March 1 of each year; however, from January 1 through April 30, any one of the 14 warning messages may be displayed.</p>

The required pictograms must be accompanied by specific images of adverse health effects of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke. The warnings must be renewed every two years pursuant to orders made by the Minister of Health. These provisions align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to cigarettes and cigars in that they require graphic warnings that occupy 50% of each main display areas of packaging of such tobacco products. However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the health warning requirements should apply to all tobacco products.</p>

	The law mandates the display of one of two text warnings occupying 30% of the front of the package, and one of 14 picture warnings with accompanying text occupying 40% of the back of the package. Tobacco products designed only for the retail travel sector (duty-free products) can carry picture warning number 14, or an alternative picture warning specifically provided for duty-free products. The warning area must be enclosed by a border, which is not included in the 30% and 40% calculation. The border brings the total size of the warning area to 43% of the front surface and 53% of the back surface.</p>

The initial pictorial warning was to appear on packages for one year, beginning on February 1, 2010. The government has twice altered the rotational time period. First, SRO 01(KE)/2010 and SRO 02(KE)/2010 delayed the implementation date, instructing that the pictorial warning was to begin appearing on packages on May 31, 2010 and continuing for one year. Second, a Ministry of Health Memorandum (No. F. 02-162007-FCTC) issued in May 2011 extends the rotation period for the current pictorial warning until December 31, 2011. Therefore, the current pictorial warning is scheduled to appear on product packaging from May 31, 2010 through December 31, 2011. SRO 01(KE)/2010 also added a grace period for manufacturers of 90 days, in the first instance starting May 31, 2010, to clear from factories/ports of entry packages with old warnings.</p>

	The above regulations do not apply to packages of tobacco products intended for smoking other than cigarettes in a retail sale, with the largest and most visible display areas exceeding 75 cm<sup>2</sup>. For these packages, the display of warnings takes up no less than 22.5 cm<sup>2</sup> on each display area.</p>
<p>
	The requirements for health warnings/messages meet the minimum FCTC Art. 11 requirements with respect to size. However, the law and regulations should be clearer on the length of a rotation period.</p>
","<p>
	The law requires text warnings to cover 30% of the front side and graphic warnings to cover 50% of the back side of the package. Such warnings must be printed on white edged by a black frame. The law lacks other details about font, border thickness, etc. Tobacco companies may exploit such ambiguities to lessen the effect of the warnings.</p>
<p>
	The law provides one main warning for the front side (""Smoking kills."") and 12 additional warnings, which include images, for the back side. The 12 warnings must appear on an equal number of packages during the year. While the warnings do not technically ""rotate,"" the law achieves a similar effect. The Ministry of Health has the power to change the law every year, which would aid in the rotation.</p>
<p>
	The law meets the minimum requirements of FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size. However, to align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require pictorial warnings covering 50% of all principal display areas. By adding such warnings, mandating the rotation schedule, and clarifying details of the warnings, the law will align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines.</p>
<p>
	Russia, as part of the Eurasian Economic Commission, has adopted stricter regulations on tobacco product packaging and labeling, which will go into effect on May 15, 2016.</p>
","<p>
	The law mandates the display of one of two text warnings occupying 30% of the front of the package, and one of 14 picture warnings with accompanying text occupying 40% of the back of the package. Tobacco products designed only for the retail travel sector (duty free products) can carry the picture warning number 14, or an alternative picture warning specifically provided for duty free products. The warning area must be enclosed by a border, which is not included in the 30% and 40% calculation. The border brings the total size of the warning area to 43% of the front surface and 53% of the back surface.</p>
<p>
	The front and back warnings must be rotated so that each warning appears a roughly equal number of times over a 12-month period (between 47.5% and 52.5% for front surface warnings, and between 4.16% and 8.33% for back surface warnings). Warnings on cartons must be rotated equally over a three-year period.</p>
<p>
	While the law aligns with the minimum size requirements of FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size (at least 30%), to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require that warnings cover at least 50% of both principal display areas, and include picture warnings on both display areas. In addition, the law should mandate that the responsible authority update the content of the warnings every 12&ndash;36 months.</p>
","<p>
	The law prescribes health warnings on each pack, carton and all forms of external packaging of tobacco products which must be displayed in indelible characters, in the form of text and color images. The health warnings must describe the harmful effects of tobacco consumption and cover at least 70% of the main surfaces, front and back of the package of tobacco and external packaging</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	However, as of the date of this review, required subsidiary legislation (e.g., implementing decrees and administrative orders) has not been issued by the designated regulatory authority to implement these provisions.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to the adoption of large, clear, visible, legible health warnings that cover at least 30% of the principal display areas. However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the enforcement decree should specify requirements for the location of health warnings; require a list of warnings which must be displayed; and require the regular rotation of designated warnings.</p>
","<p>
	Article 12 of the Tobacco Control Act requires pack warnings (pictures or text or both) to be displayed on at least 50% of the main display areas in Creole, English, or French.</p>
<p>
	The Tobacco (Health Warnings and Messages) Regulations, 2012 prescribe graphic health warnings to be displayed on product packaging ÔÇ£in the format and proportion of the image and text as set out in the Schedule.ÔÇØ ┬áAlthough the regulations do not specify the size, it is assumed that the warnings must cover 50% of the main display areas (a minimum of 50% is required under the law).┬á The Schedule contains 12 total warnings, three sets of the same four warnings, each set in a different language ÔÇô Creole, English, and French.┬á Although not specified in the law or regulations, it is assumed that the warnings must appear on an equal number of packages over the length of the rotation period because the regulations state that ÔÇ£all warnings and messages shall be displayed for not less than three years.ÔÇØ</p>
<p>
	The law and regulations align┬áwith FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to the health warnings.┬á The law and regulations could be improved by specifying the exact size of the health warnings and the manner in which the warnings are to rotate within the three-year period.</p>
","<p>
	Each tobacco product package, unless spherical or cylindrical, must display one warning on each of the two largest external surfaces, occupying at least 50% of each surface.┬á For spherical containers, one warning must be printed, occupying 50% of the external surface of the container.┬á For cylindrical or conical containers, one warning must be printed on 50% of the largest external surface of the container.</p>
<p>
	Warnings must be parallel to and as close to the top edge of the container as possible.┬á In addition, warnings must be positioned in the same direction as other information on the packaging.┬á</p>
<p>
	Except for small containers, there are a total of six warnings, including text and a picture, set forth in the First Schedule. The text must occupy at least 35% of the total area and the image must appear above the text and occupy at least 50% of the total warning area. For small tobacco product containers (external surface area of 9,000 mm2 or less), there are a total of six text-only warnings set forth in the Second Schedule.</p>
<p>
	Warnings must be rotated so that each warning appears on an equal number of containers of each kind of tobacco product over a 24-month period.┬á The law does not specify a timeframe within which the health warnings must be updated.</p>
<p>
	The text of each warning must be printed in white against a black background, other than the word ÔÇ£WARNINGÔÇØ which must appear in red.</p>
<p>
	For smoked tobacco products packaging, the law meets FCTC Art. 11 but does not align with some important aspects of the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, particularly with regard to updating the message content.┬á The law should specify that the Minister should update the messages every 12 to 36 months.┬á In addition, the warnings to be displayed on small tobacco containers should contain both pictures and text.</p>
","<p>
	The primary warning must occupy 15% of the front of the package and be situated at the top. The secondary warning must occupy 25% of the back of the package and be situated at the top. The side panel warning regarding the contents of tar and nicotine must occupy 20% of one of the sides. The text must be surrounded by a border and the text itself must occupy between 60% to 70% of the total warning display area.</p>
<p>
	Warnings must appear in black, red, or blue print on white background on half the packages, and appear in white print on black, red, or blue background on half the packages. The primary (front) and side panels warnings must appear in capital letters.</p>
<p>
	Concurrent rotation is required: each of the eight primary warnings, with associated secondary warnings, must appear on an equal number of packages, within a 10% variance, in a 12-month period. There are no requirements for consecutive rotation.</p>
<p>
	The warning provisions do not align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines. To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines warnings should occupy 50% or more of the principal display areas (PDAs) but shall be no less than 30% of the PDAs.</p>
","<p>
	Each package of smoked tobacco products must carry one of two general warnings (&ldquo;Smoking kills&rdquo; or &ldquo;Smoking seriously harms you and others around you&rdquo;) and one of 14 additional warnings. The general warning occupies 30% of the front of the pack and the additional warning occupies 40% of the back of the pack. With borders, the coverage in practice is 43% of the front and 53% of the back of packages.</p>
<p>
	The warnings must be surrounded by a border between 3mm and 4mm in width, which does not count as part of the space to be occupied by the warnings. Outside the border for the additional warning shall appear the words: &ldquo;Health Authority Warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The general warnings and additional warnings must be rotated so that they appear on an equal number of packages. The law does not specify a time-frame within which the health warnings must be updated.</p>
<p>
	For tobacco products other than cigarettes, where the most visible surface is greater than 75 cm<sup>2</sup>, the general and additional warnings shall occupy at least 22.5 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>
	To fully align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should specify that health warnings shall be updated every 12 to 36 months and warnings should cover at least 50% of the principal display areas and aim to cover as much of the principal display areas as possible.</p>
","<p>
	Regulations require health warnings in the form of pictures and text on each cigarette packet, package or carton containing cigarettes. The warnings must be placed on the top surface area of both front and back sides and must cover 60% of the top surface area of the front and back. The regulations establish four categories of warnings, and manufacturers must display one type of warning from each category at any given time with warnings changed every six months. (Two of the four categories however contain only one health warning.) Importers of cigarettes from outside Sri Lanka must use a sticker health warning. These provisions align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines.</p>
","<p>
	The law requires that one of two text warnings occupy 30% of the most visible surface (front) of the package. These two main warnings must be rotated so that each occurs regularly.</p>
<p>
	One of 14 additional text warnings must occupy 40% of the second most visible surface (back) of the package. These 14 additional warnings also should be rotated so that each appears regularly. The warnings should be printed in black on a white background. The warnings must be surrounded by a black border not less than 3mm and not more than 4mm wide. The border is not counted as part of the minimum space to be covered by the warning.</p>
<p>
The law aligns with the minimum requirements of FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, in that the text warnings occupy at least 30% of the principal display areas. However, to fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require that the warnings occupy at least 50% of both principal display areas and contain pictorial images as well as text.
</p>
","The regulations authorize six pictorial health warnings with accompanying text to be displayed on cigarette packaging. One of these combination warnings must occupy 35% of the front of the packaging and another must occupy 35% of the back of the packaging. 

The warnings should be located at the top of the package, printed in black font on white background. The warnings should be rotated so that all six warnings appear with equal frequency. The law and regulations do not state how frequently the set of six should be updated, and the same set of six warnings has been in rotation since January 2009.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to size of the warnings, in that warnings on both principal display areas are at least 30% of the surface area. The law also aligns in that the warnings contain graphic images. However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the warnings should occupy at least 50% of both principal display areas.

	Section 6 of the Tobacco Products Act (TPA) states: ÔÇ£No person shall sell tobacco products unless the packet containing it displays in the prescribed form and manner such information as stipulated in the Second Schedule to this Act.ÔÇØ The Second Schedule requires that any one of ten text-only health messages ÔÇ£shall be displayed in Kiswahili and English on every packet of cigarettes or tobacco productÔÇØ.</p>
<p>
	The TPA gives no specific instructions on the size, format, or placement of the health warning on the tobacco product package. It appears to allow manufacturers to choose any one of the ten text-only warnings, and does not require equal distribution of the warnings or rotation of the warnings.</p>
<p>
	The law states that the Minister may ÔÇ£change the format, type, size and text of any of the health messagesÔÇØ. To date, the Minister has not issued regulations addressing format, type, size or text.</p>
<p>
	To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law or regulations implementing the law should specify the size, placement, format and rotation of the health messages. The required size should occupy 50% or more, but no less than 30%, of the principal display areas of the tobacco product package. In addition, the law or regulations should address rotation of the health messages and require updating of message every 12 to 36 months. To fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law or implementing regulations should require combined picture and text health warnings and messages.</p>
","<p>
	Under the current law for cigarettes, images must occupy 85% of both principal display areas (PDAs) and be printed in four colors. Images and text must be placed at the top edge of both PDAs of the pack or carton. Rotation of the set of images is at the rate of 5,000 packs/cartons per image. The law does not state how often the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) must update the images and text.</p>
<p>
	In addition to the pictorial health warnings on each PDA, each side panel of the unit (e.g., pack) and outside (e.g., carton) packaging must display a text warning statement.&nbsp; One statement, which includes details about toxins, carcinogens, or other substances in tobacco products, must be printed on both sides and must occupy no less than 60% of each side.&nbsp; If the unit or outside packaging is not rectangular, the packaging must bear the statement on two sides, each side with an area of at least 10% of the total surface area of the pack or container.</p>
<p>
	For cigars, picture and text warnings must occupy 50% of both PDAs (30% if the package is not rectangular). The warnings shall be printed in four colors. The law does not state how often the MoPH must update the images and text of cigar warnings. MoPH last updated the images and text for cigar warnings in 2007.</p>
<p>
	To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should specify that health warnings should be updated every 12-36 months.</p>
","<p>
	The law and a decree require packaging of tobacco products and derivative products (e.g., e-cigarettes) to display text-only health warnings covering 65 percent of each principal display area and rotating every 24 months.┬á In addition, such packaging must contain two qualitative constituents and emissions statements on the sides of the packaging where the health warnings are not displayed. Health warnings must be in the principal languages of Togo.</p>

	The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines.</p>
","<p>
The law requires health messages covering 65% of the front and back of all tobacco products, including water pipes and tobacco cartons.  The front side contains one of two text warnings and the quitline number.   The warnings must be printed within a black frame. The font, size, location, and color of the text is specified, and the text must be in Turkish. The back side contains a composite warning that contains one of 14 pictures and accompanying text, also within a black frame. The companies must ensure that each of the combined warnings are separately seen for a duration between 5% to 9% of each period.  </p>
<p>

The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to the size and rotation of the warnings. </p>","<p>
	The law currently requires text warnings on the front and back of all consumer packages of tobacco products.┬á The text warning must take up no less than 30% of the large side of the pack (i.e., front), with the warning that ÔÇ£Smoking Kills.ÔÇØ The other side of the pack must have one of twelve warnings, which may be accompanied by a picture, and the warning must take up no less than 50% of the back of the pack.┬á Currently, however, these warnings are text only as pictorial images have not been issued.  The warnings are to rotate concurrently; there are no requirements for consecutive rotation.</p>
<p>
	Both warnings must be placed within a black border, and the text must be in black letters on a white background, with a big, bold, and easily read font.</p>
<p>
	The current law requires warnings printed on the consumer pack of all tobacco products; however, the term ÔÇ£consumer packÔÇØ is limited to cigarettes. Therefore, the law does not provide for health warnings on smoked tobacco products that are not cigarettes.</p>
<p>
	Currently, the law meets the minimum requirements of FCTC Art. 11 with respect to size for packaging and labeling of cigarettes.┬á However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require graphic health warnings covering at least 50% of the principal display areas.┬á In addition, the law should require that the content of the warnings be updated every 12-36 months.</p>
<p>
	New warning requirements were issued in May 2014. Once in effect, the amended law will require larger graphic health warnings on no less than 65% of the two largest surface areas of consumer packaging. The pictures must be printed on the upper part of the pack in high resolution.┬á The text will be printed above the picture in bold, clear, and easily readable Arial font, in contrast to the picture.┬á</p>
<p>
	Additionally, all smoked tobacco products (other than cigarettes) will be required to have the warning that ÔÇ£Smoking will harm your health.ÔÇØ If the package is such that it is impossible to print the warning, such as individual cigars or cigarillos, then the warnings must be included on a package insert.</p>
<p>
	The warning labels enter into force 12 months after the authorized agency approves the list of drawings, pictograms and/or photos on the harms of smoking. As of the date of this review, the authorized agencies have not yet released the new set of warnings, so an implementation date is uncertain.┬á</p>
","<p>
	Pictorial warnings were required beginning September 30, 2012.┬á The law requires one main text warning occupying 50% of the main display area, and one of ten secondary pictorial warnings with accompanying text occupying 50% of the secondary display area.  The warnings must be bordered by, at the least, a 3mm black frame, which is part of the 50% warning area.  Decree No. 306 contains the ten pictorial warnings and specifies that the pictorial warnings and their accompanying text must occupy at least 40% of the area within the black border.</p>
<p>
	Rotation of the secondary pictorial warnings appearing on the back of packages is required.┬á However, it is not specified whether several pictorial warnings are to appear concurrently or consecutively.┬á┬áThe law requires review of the warnings by the Cabinet of Ministers every five years.┬á However, if the warnings are to appear consecutively, the length of a given rotation period during the five-year intervals is unspecified.</p>
<p>
	The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to requiring warnings that occupy 50% of principal display areas and that contain both pictures and text.  However, the set of health warnings should be reviewed every 12ÔÇô36 months.</p>
","<p>
	One of the four authorized picture and text warnings must be displayed on 80% of the lower portion of each of the two principal display areas (front and back) of each tobacco product package. The four images have been arranged into three pairs or &quot;series&quot; which prescribe the warnings to appear on the front and back. Each of the series must appear on an equal number of packs for each brand. Warnings must be rotated every 12 months.</p>
<p>
	The following descriptive statement of constituents and emissions must be displayed on one side panel: &ldquo;Tobacco smoke contains toxic and poisonous substances such as cyanide and arsenic.&rdquo;&nbsp; The statement must occupy the entire side panel.</p>
<p>
	These provisions meet FCTC Art. 11 with respect to warning size, location, and rotation.</p>
","<p>
	Tobacco products must carry pictorial health warnings covering 50 percent of the front and back of unit and outside packaging and labeling. Six prescribed warnings must be concurrently displayed for a two-year period, after which the warnings must be changed.&nbsp; As of November 8, 2013, all packs of tobacco products are required to display the prescribed health warnings.</p>
<p>
	The government is required to increase the size of warnings within a certain time period it deems &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;. As of the date of this review, the warning size increase and time period have not been specified.</p>
<p>
	The requirements for health warnings/messages align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines.</p>

	The law mandates the display of one of two text warnings occupying 30% of the front of the package, and one of 14 picture warnings with accompanying text occupying 40% of the back of the package. Tobacco products only designed for the retail travel sector (duty-free products) can carry the picture warning number 14, or an alternative picture warning specifically provided for duty-free products. The warning area must be enclosed by a border, which is not included in the 30% and 40% calculation. The border brings the total size of the warning area to 43% of the front surface and 53% of the back surface.</p>

	For packaging where it is difficult to distinguish the main surfaces or where it would be difficult to display the designated warnings, the Ministry of Finance is authorized to decide on the requirements for displaying health warnings.

	The law and a decree require packaging of tobacco products and derivative products (e.g., e-cigarettes) to display text-only health warnings covering 65 percent of each principal display area and rotating every 24 months. Such packaging must contain two qualitative constituents and emissions statements on the sides of the packaging where the health warnings are not displayed. Health warnings must be in the principal languages of Togo.</p>
<p>
	The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines.</p>
","The law requires health messages covering 65% of the widest surface of smokeless tobacco products, including cartons.  The message contains a single text warning stating: ""This tobacco product may damage your health and may create addiction.ÔÇØ   The font, size, location, and color of the text is specified, and the text must be in Turkish. There are no smokeless products currently licensed for sale in Turkey. </p>
<p>

 The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to the size of the warnings. </p>","<p>
	The current law requires warnings printed on the consumer pack of all tobacco products; however, the definition of ÔÇ£consumer packÔÇØ is limited to cigarettes. Therefore, the law does not provide for health warnings for smokeless products.</p>
<p>
	New warning requirements were issued in May 2014. Once in effect, the amended law will require smokeless products carry one textual warning label that reads: ÔÇ£This tobacco product will harm your health.ÔÇØ┬á The warning must be placed within a black border, together which must be no less than 30% of the front surface or insert.┬á The warning must be printed in black letters on a white background, in bold, clear, legible font. This warning must be in place as of January 1, 2015.</p>
<p>
	Once in effect, the new warning requirements will meet FCTC Art. 11 with respect to minimum size.┬á However, to more fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require large rotating graphic warnings on all tobacco products, including all smokeless tobacco products.</p>
","<p>
	Although the law requires health warnings on all tobacco products, the contents of the warnings themselves are applicable to smoked and not smokeless tobacco products.</p>
<p>
	Pictorial warnings were required beginning September 30, 2012.&nbsp; The law requires one main text warning occupying 50% of the main display area, and one of ten secondary pictorial warnings with accompanying text occupying 50% of the secondary display area.&nbsp; The warnings must be bordered by, at the least, a 3mm black frame, which is part of the 50% warning area.&nbsp; Decree No. 306 contains the 10 pictorial warnings and specifies that the pictorial warnings and their accompanying text must occupy at least 40% of the area within the black border.</p>
<p>
	Rotation of the secondary pictorial warnings appearing on the back of packages is required.&nbsp; However, it is not specified whether several pictorial warnings are to appear concurrently or consecutively.&nbsp; The law requires review of the warnings by the Cabinet of Ministers every five years.&nbsp; However, if the warnings are to appear consecutively, the length of a given rotation period during the five-year intervals is unspecified.</p>
<p>
	The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to requiring warnings that occupy 50% of principal display areas and that contain both pictures and text.&nbsp; However, the set of health warnings should be reviewed every 12&ndash;36 months.</p>
","<p>
	One of the four authorized picture and text warnings must be displayed on 80% of the lower portion of each of the two principal display areas (front and back) of each tobacco product package. The four images have been arranged into three pairs or &quot;series&quot; which prescribe the warnings to appear on the front and back. Each of the series must appear on an equal number of packs for each brand. Warnings must be rotated every 12 months.</p>
<p>
	The following descriptive statement of constituents and emissions must be displayed on one side panel: &ldquo;Tobacco smoke contains toxic and poisonous substances such as cyanide and arsenic.&rdquo; The statement must occupy the entire side panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Although these warnings are required on all tobacco products, the health messages are specific to smoked tobacco products, not smokeless tobacco products.</p>
<p>
	To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, an ordinance should provide health warnings specific to smokeless tobacco products.</p>
","<p>
	The requirements for health warning and messages apply to tobacco products without making a distinction between smoked and smokeless products. However, details for the warnings are specified and shown in the 2013 Packaging and Labeling Circular for rectangular packs of smoked products only. Therefore, the regulatory status of the location and size of the warnings includes a notation of &quot;Uncertain&quot;. Although the law and regulations align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, health warning requirements for smokeless tobacco products could be made clearer. In addition, the contents of the warnings to appear on smokeless tobacco products should pertain to the health effects of smokeless tobacco.</p>
","<p>
	The law requires producers of smokeless tobacco products to put the following warning on the most visible surface: ÔÇ£This tobacco product can damage your health and is addictive.ÔÇØ</p>
<p>
	The law does not align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines because it requires the display of only one health message on one principal display area. To fully align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should require that one of a multiple set of picture warnings be displayed on both sides of the package of smokeless tobacco products, occupying at least 50% of the display area. In addition, the law should mandate that the warnings be updated every 12ÔÇô36 months.</p>

To meet FCTC Art. 11, the law should prohibit the use of terms, descriptors, or other signs that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products. ","The law prohibits false, questionable, or deceptive advertising on tobacco product packaging.  The Executive Order specifically prohibits the use of misleading terms, descriptors, trademarks, and figurative or other signs.

The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to the use of terms, descriptors, or other signs that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products. ","The law and regulations prohibit the use of the terms ÔÇ£LightÔÇØ, ÔÇ£UltralightÔÇØ, ÔÇ£SmoothÔÇØ, ÔÇ£SupersmoothÔÇØ, and synonyms or associated symbols, on packaging and labeling.

The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to misleading tobacco product packaging and labeling.","The law does not meet FCTC Art. 11 or align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines with respect to the use of terms, descriptors, or other signs that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products. Although the ConsumerÔÇÖs Rights Code prohibits ÔÇ£misbrandingÔÇØ or industry practices that mislead consumers, there are no specific laws addressing tobacco products. Tobacco manufacturers may maintain colors, numbers, and other indicia (e.g., colors connoting lower tar delivery to smokers) that directly or indirectly create a false impression about a cigarette brand being less harmful than another brand and this is done without legal consequence. To meet FCTC Art. 11, the law should prohibit these types of misleading indicia on all tobacco packaging and labeling. ","It is forbidden to place on tobacco product packages any texts, names, trademarks, or signs suggesting that a given product is less harmful than other products.  Polish legislation is not as precise as FCTC regulations in this regard, which creates many opportunities to get around the regulations. In practical terms, signs such as ÔÇ£lightÔÇØ , ÔÇ£superlight,ÔÇØ or ÔÇ£mildÔÇØ have disappeared from packages. However, the colors remained, which until recently corresponded with the above types of cigarettes. Consequently, while purchasing cigarettes and asking for e.g., Marlboro Lights, a person will likely get Marlboro cigarettes in a white-color package. 

Although the provisions of the law meet FCTC Art. 11, the implementation of the law does not. To meet FCTC Art. 11, all forms of misleading descriptors and images, including color schemes, should be prohibited.","The general law on advertising prohibits unfair and inaccurate advertising. The law defines ""inaccurate advertising"" as that which contains inaccurate information about the benefits of an advertised product in comparison with other products being in circulation produced by other manufacturers or sold by other sellers.  

While such language should prohibit false, misleading, or deceptive promotion on tobacco product packaging, the technical regulations for tobacco products expressly allow the use of misleading terms like light, ultra light, low, etc., so long as such products contain a warning that such product is not less harmful to health.  

To meet FCTC Art. 11, the tobacco control regulations should be amended to prohibit misleading tobacco product packaging and labeling. ","The law prohibits the use of any name, brand name, text, trademark, or pictorial or any other representation or sign which suggest that that a tobacco product is less harmful to health than another tobacco product.

Packaging and labeling must not under any circumstances contain terms such as ÔÇ£low tar contentÔÇØ, ÔÇ£lightÔÇØ, ÔÇ£ultra-lightÔÇØ, or ÔÇ£mildÔÇØ, in any language at all.ÔÇØ


However, as of the date of this review, required subsidiary legislation (e.g., implementing decrees and administrative orders) has not been issued by the designated regulatory authority to implement these provisions.

The law meets FCTC Art. 11 in prohibiting misleading tobacco product packaging and labeling that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products. 
","The law prohibits the use of any misleading term, descriptor, trademark, figure, color, shape, or any other sign that directly or indirectly creates a false impression that a particular tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products.  The terms ÔÇ£light,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£ultra-light,ÔÇØ and ÔÇ£mildÔÇØ are specifically included in a list of examples of prohibited terms. 

To ensure FCTC Art. 11 is clearly met with regard to misleading terms and indicia on tobacco packaging and labeling, the Ministry should include ÔÇ£low tarÔÇØ as a prohibited term in regulations, if legally permissible.","Pursuant to 2010 amendments to the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, the law prohibits the use of packaging or labeling that promotes any tobacco product by any means that are ÔÇ£false, misleading, deceptive or likely to create an erroneous impression about the characteristics, health effects, hazards or emissions of the tobacco product.ÔÇØ Specifically, the law prohibits the use of any ÔÇ£term, descriptor or trade mark, or any figurative or other sign, that directly or indirectly creates the false impression that a particular tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products.ÔÇØ In addition, the Minister of Health has the power to issue regulations prescribing other such terms that are prohibited on tobacco product packaging and labeling.

Together, the law and regulations align with FCTC Art. 11 with respect to a prohibition on misleading packaging and labeling.","The law prohibits the use of any misleading term, descriptor, trade mark, figurative, or other sign that directly or indirectly creates the impression that a particular tobacco product is less harmful than another tobacco product.

","The law prohibits the use on tobacco product packaging of ÔÇ£expressions such as light, low tar, or any other misleading words or marks implicating that smoking has no harmful effects, or only has minor harmful effects, on health.ÔÇØ This is interpreted as prohibiting all misleading terms, descriptors, trademarks, or figurative or other signs.

The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to misleading terms and descriptors, trademarks, figurative or other signs.
","Section 27 of the Tobacco Products Act states that ÔÇ£No person shall promote a tobacco product by any means including packaging that is likely to create an erroneous impression about the characteristics, or health hazards of the tobacco product or its emissions.ÔÇØ This could be interpreted as prohibiting all misleading terms, descriptors, trademarks, or figurative or other signs. However, because the law does not clearly prohibit figurative or other signs, such as logos, colors, or brand images, the regulatory status ÔÇ£Some RestrictionsÔÇØ is given.

To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the law should clearly prohibit all misleading tobacco product packaging and labeling including terms, descriptors, trademarks, or figurative or other signs (e.g., logos, colors, brand images) that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products.
","The regulations on misleading descriptors prohibit the use of a wide array of  terms and related symbols, including: 1) ÔÇ£mild,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£medium,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£light,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£ultra-light,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£low tar,ÔÇØ or other words or statements that might cause consumers to understand that such tobacco products are less dangerous than other products; 2) ÔÇ£cool,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£ice,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£frost,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£crisp,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£fresh,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£mint,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£mellow,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£rich,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£aromatic,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£special aroma,ÔÇØ or other words or statements describing fragrance or flavor that might encourage consumers to use such products; 3) ÔÇ£smooth,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£natural,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£special,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£genuine,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£luminous,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£extra,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£premium,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£quality,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£select,ÔÇØ or other words or statements describing characteristics or qualities that might encourage consumers to use such products.  ÔÇ£StatementsÔÇØ include ÔÇ£writing, symbol, or image,ÔÇØ however the law does not specifically prohibit the use of figurative yields, which can mislead consumers as to the safety of a tobacco product.

To align with the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, figures for emission yields should be prohibited. ","The Tobacco Control Law prohibits the use of ÔÇ£terms such as ÔÇÿlow in tar,ÔÇÖ ÔÇÿlight,ÔÇÖ ÔÇÿultralight,ÔÇÖ ÔÇÿmild,ÔÇÖ or any other term of a character that would encourage the consumption of tobacco and its derivative products, in any language.ÔÇØ  However, the law does not prohibit trademarks or figurative or other signs (e.g., logos, colors, brand images) that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products. To meet FCTC Art. 11, the law should prohibit these types of misleading indicia on all tobacco packaging and labeling.","The law states that ÔÇ£text, names, brands, phrases, similes, pictures, signs or colors and color combinations that promote consumption or mislead the consumer cannot be usedÔÇØ on tobacco product packaging. The law therefore meets FCTC Art. 11 in this respect by banning the use of terms, descriptors, or other signs that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products. 
","The law prohibits the following claims on the consumer packaging for tobacco products: that consumption of this kind of cigarette lowers the risk of diseases related to the consumption of tobacco products; that this tobacco product is less dangerous for health than other tobacco products; and that the risk of disease related to the consumption of tobacco products is lowered due to the presence, absence or lowering of substances given off during consumption of the tobacco product, other than nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide.
<br><br>
To meet the requirements of FCTC Art. 11, the law should prohibit any misleading terms, descriptors, trademarks, figurative or other signs, such as colors or brand images that directly or indirectly create a false impression that a tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products.  

As of January 1, 2015, the amended law will prohibit information on the consumer packaging: that misleads the consumers, including the use of descriptions, trademarks, other symbols which directly or indirectly create a false impression that the tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products; and that uses the words and phrases ÔÇ£with low tar content,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£light,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£ultra-light,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£mildÔÇØ or other similar words and phrases. Once in effect, this amended provision will meet the requirements of FCTC Art. 11 in this regard. 
","The law prohibits the use on product packaging of misleading terms, descriptors, trademarks, pictures, symbols, or other signs that may mislead or create a false impression about tobacco products and their health effects, including terms such as ÔÇ£low tar,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£light,ÔÇØ ÔÇ£super light,ÔÇØ and ÔÇ£ultra light.ÔÇØ 

The law meets FCTC Art. 11 with respect to misleading terms, descriptors, and other signs.","The law prohibits the use of ÔÇ£terms, descriptive elements, trademarks or business names, figurative symbols, or anything else that may have the direct or indirect effect of creating the false impression that a specific tobacco product is less harmful than others.ÔÇØ  Ordinance No. 514 further elaborates the ban on misleading tobacco packaging and labeling (pursuant to Law No. 18.256) by mandating that every brand of tobacco product may have only one form of packaging presentation. Therefore, misleading tobacco brand variants are prohibited including, but not limited to, tobacco packages using color coded gradations to falsely imply that one tobacco brand delivers less tar than another brand.  
These provisions meet FCTC Art. 11 with respect to misleading tobacco product packaging and labeling. ","The law prohibits the use of misleading terms and the circular prohibits the use of ÔÇ£forms or wordsÔÇØ that are misleading in that they result in a suggestion that one tobacco product is less harmful than others or is less harmful to the human health.

In addition, the law does not provide for corrective action except insofar as the jurisdiction must order the prohibition of any similar activity and seize and destroy tobacco products sold in contravention of the Law. Further, the fines are too low to have a deterrent effect on business entities. The law does not explicitly provide a mechanism for the application of fines in a graded fashion but simply states that the fine may extend to 1000 taka.

","In terms of penalties, the law does not distinguish between manufacturer, importer, wholesaler or retailer but simply imposes penalties on persons (both buyers and sellers) who contravene the provisions of the law.

Penalties include: (a) imprisonment lasting from one to five years; (b) a fine ranging from 10 million to 100 million Francs; or a combination of both; (c) newspaper publications informing the public of convictions, at the expense of the convicted offender; and (d) suspension of any activity giving rise to the offense.

 
In cases of repeat offenses, the punishment shall be doubled, and other, supplemental penalties may be imposed at the courtÔÇÖs discretion if the court ascertains that the offender derived financial advantage from committing the offense in question.

The law provides that sanctions can be applied in a graded fashion and fines are doubled in the case of repeat offenses.

Violations are punishable by fines up to 10,000 rupees, imprisonment up to two years, or both.  
Penalties are the same for manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, and retailers.

The penalty provisions do not align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines because they do not provide for a range of penalties (such as license revocation) or increased sanctions for repeat offenses.  In addition, penalties are not higher for manufacturers, wholesalers, and importers than they are for retailers, although these types of business entities are unlikely to be deterred by low fines and penalties.","Available relevant penalties and corrective actions include the seizure of products.

For wholesalers who violate the warning and labeling requirements, the lesser amount would be $2,000, if compounded.

The same fines for manufacturer, importer, wholesaler, and retailer may not be appropriate. FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines para. 56 provides that Parties should specify a range of fines or other penalties commensurate with the severity of the violation and whether it is a repeat violation.

The law also does not provide for corrective action except for seizure of tobacco products.  Further, the law does not explicitly provide a mechanism for the application of fines in a graded fashion but simply states that the fine may extend to 2000 rupees and/or imprisonment not to exceed one year.

To align with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines, the penalty provisions should provide for a range of penalties, including license suspension or revocation, increased sanctions for repeat offenses, and seizure of products.

Subsequent reoccurrences are subject to a similar fine and temporary closure of fifteen (15) days. In addition, noncompliant products are subject to seizure.

The law aligns with FCTC Art. 11 and the FCTC Art. 11 Guidelines because it provides for a range of penalties, higher penalties for repeat violations, and imposes liability on wholesalers and retailers in addition to manufacturers and importers.","Article 2 of the 2007 Law (adding Art. 6 Bis (6) to the 1981 Law) establishes a special unit within the Ministry of Health to enforce the law.

Article 3 of Law 2002 (amending Art. 7 of Law 1981) imposes fines ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 pounds, and/or a prison term up to one year.  In the case of repeat offenses, the penalty is both a fine and prison term.
