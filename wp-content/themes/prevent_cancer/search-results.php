                <p>Medicare recipients received welcome news today. After months of lobbying from cancer patient and advocacy organizations, including the Prevent Cancer Foundation, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a draft decision requiring Medicare coverage of low-dose computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening for at-risk beneficiaries. Prevent Cancer Foundation President and Founder Carolyn "Bo" Aldigé states that "CT lung scans are proven, effective screening measures that save lives. We have long advocated for these services to be available to individuals at high-risk for lung cancer and we are pleased to see that CMS has moved forward with this decision."</p>
